<h2>FOREWORD</h2>


<p>All of us like to think that our actions and reactions are a result
of logical thought processes, but the fact is that suggestion influences
our thinking a great deal more than logic. Consciously or
unconsciously, our feelings about almost everything are largely
molded by ready-made opinions and attitudes fostered by our
mass methods of communication. We cannot buy a bar of soap or
a filtered cigarette without paying tribute to the impact of suggestion.
Right or wrong, most of us place more confidence in what
"they" say than we do in our own powers of reason. This is the
basic reason why psychiatrists are in short supply. We distrust our
own mental processes and want an expert to tell us what to think
and feel.</p>

<p>Despite this tendency to adopt our attitudes from others, man
has always been dimly aware that he can influence his own destiny
by directing his thoughts and actions into constructive channels.
He has always, to some extent, known that his mind exerts a powerful
influence on his body, and that thoughts can have harmful
or helpful effects on his emotional and physical health. The ancient
Egyptian sleep temples and the attempts by early physicians
to drive evil spirits out of the body were both attempts to influence
the body through the mind.</p>

<p>The unprecedented sale of <i>The Power of Positive Thinking</i>
by Norman Vincent Peale and other inspirational literature proves
that millions of modern people recognize the efficacy of constructive
thoughts. What most of them do not recognize is that they
are capable of implanting these beneficial thoughts in their own
minds without reference to any outside agencies. This can be done
through self-hypnosis.</p>

<p>In modern society we have many cults, religions and methodologies
which have mental discipline as their goal. The best
example of a methodology is psychosomatic medicine which deals
with the interrelationship of the mind and body in the production
of mental or physical illness. The rapid growth of hypnosis in the
last few years is another example, and it is gratifying to see that
the emphasis in this field is now shifting from hetero-hypnosis
to self-hypnosis.</p>

<p>Self-hypnosis is a highly suggestible state wherein the individual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[<a href="./images/8.png">8</a>]</span>
can direct suggestions to himself. It is a powerful tool in any
therapeutic process, and highly motivated subjects can parallel
the success of hetero-hypnosis through their own efforts. Self-hypnosis
can be used as a palliative agent and can even afford
lasting results in many areas of the organism. Self-hypnosis can
alleviate distressing symptoms, substitute strong responses for
weak responses, help overcome bad habits, create good habits
and help one's power of concentration. The total personality is
eventually changed to the point where it can function adequately
in an increasingly difficult environment.</p>

<p>In learning self-hypnosis, the subject does not relinquish control
of himself as is commonly believed. Actually, more control
is gained. Self-sufficiency and self-confidence are inevitable results.
It is well to remember, however, that even good things may
be overdone, and good judgment is necessary for favorable
results. Neither hypnosis nor self-hypnosis should ever be used
indiscriminately. The effectiveness of self-hypnosis depends upon
many factors. Strong motivation, intelligent application of suggestions
and diligence are prerequisites.</p>

<p>We are not suggesting that self-hypnosis can take the place of
all forms of psychotherapy. We do recommend it as an adjunct to
therapy when indicated. Used judiciously, it can contribute a great
deal to the individual's physical and emotional well-being and
happiness.</p>

<p>As a professional hypnotist for many years, I have seen astounding
and apparently miraculous results by individuals using
self-hypnosis. Many of these cases seem unbelievable to those not
familiar with hypnotic phenomena. It should be remembered,
though, that many individuals seek hypnosis only when all other
forms of therapy have failed. This is so common that hypnosis
has come to be known as a port of last call. Yet, despite the seeming
hopelessness of such cases, medical literature lists thousands
of remarkable recoveries.</p>

<p>There is nothing hit or miss about hypnosis. Used intelligently,
the results are the same for all those who are properly motivated.
Nor are the results singular to modern hypnotists alone. In reviewing
the literature going back more than 100 years, the same
gratifying results were obtained. The reader would do well to
scan some out-of-print books on hypnosis at the library to understand
the point further.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[<a href="./images/9.png">9</a>]</span></p>

<p>This book is written in terms that are comprehensible to the
layman. The step-by-step instructions should afford the reader a
means of acquiring self-hypnosis. The necessary material is here.
The reader need only follow the instructions as they are given.</p>

<p>The author wishes to thank Robert S. Starrett, member of the
American Medical Writers' Association, for his valuable help
in the editorial preparation of this book.</p>

<p>It is the author's hope that you will, through the selective use
of self-hypnosis, arrive at a more rewarding, well-adjusted and
fuller life.</p>

<h2><a name="chapter1" id="chapter1"></a><i>Chapter 1</i></h2>

<h3>What You Should Know About Self-Hypnosis</h3>


<p>Hypnosis has been defined as a state of heightened suggestibility
in which the subject is able to uncritically accept
ideas for self-improvement and act on them appropriately.
When a hypnotist hypnotizes his subject, it is known as
hetero-hypnosis. When an individual puts himself into
a state of hypnosis, it is known as self-hypnosis. In both
cases, the subject has achieved a heightened state of suggestibility.
Even in hetero-hypnosis, the subject really controls
the response to suggestions. Actually, all hypnosis
is really a matter of self-hypnosis. The subject enters into
the hypnotic state when he is completely ready to do so.
This may require from one to many attempts before it is
achieved. Even if the subject insists that he wants to be
hypnotized immediately, he may be resisting hypnosis
unconsciously.</p>

<p>In self-hypnosis the same thing usually takes place. The
subject is anxious to achieve self-hypnosis, but somehow
the state eludes him. What's wrong? It may be that he is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[<a href="./images/12.png">12</a>]</span>
unconsciously resisting it, hasn't conditioned himself sufficiently,
or has achieved the hypnotic state and doesn't
know he is in the state. This last statement may be surprising,
but we will examine it in detail a little later on.</p>

<p>Most experts agree that about 90 percent of the population
can be hypnotized. My own feeling is that probably
99 percent can be hypnotized. Who among us is not influenced
by suggestion? Aren't we all, as we have seen,
influenced by the suggestions of advertising? Don't we all
have a tendency to believe what we read in the paper, hear
on the radio or see on television? Aren't we all convinced
that a name-brand article is better than one that is not so
well-known?</p>

<p>Suggestion plays a tremendously important role in our
daily lives. It begins from naming the baby with an appropriate
name to securing a suitable place for interment. I
would like to call the reader's attention to a fascinating
book dealing with the unconscious reasons why we do
many of the things that we do. You will be intrigued with
every page of the book. It is called <i>The Hidden Persuaders</i>
by Vance Packard.</p>

<p>My contention is that we are all suggestible and, therefore,
being hypnotized or hypnotizing ourselves is just a
matter of increasing the suggestibility that we already possess.
Doesn't the hypnotist begin by suggesting relaxation?
Doesn't he usually begin by requesting the subject to fix
his attention on a particular object? Next, he suggests to
the subject that his eyes are becoming heavy and tired.
As soon as the subject closes his eyes, he suggests that he
will be in a deep hypnotic state. I am sure that you are
familiar with this procedure. With each step, the hypnotist
is guiding the subject along directed lines to get him
to accept further suggestions without question or doubt.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[<a href="./images/13.png">13</a>]</span>
When the subject achieves the ultimate state in this procedure,
he has been hypnotized. He then accepts suggestions
without equivocation.</p>

<p>Let us continue with this same thought. Suppose I say
to you, "I'm going to stick you with this pin. It won't
hurt." Would you let me stick you with the pin? Obviously
not. Let us suppose that you have been hypnotized and
I repeat the same suggestion. What happens then? You
readily accept the suggestion as being factual. Should I
proceed to stick you with the pin, you do not even flinch.
In fact, you do not even feel the pain. Does this sound
incredible? Isn't this exactly the same procedure that the
dentist uses with his patient when he has hypnotized him
for the purpose of painless dentistry?</p>

<p>Achieving hypnosis, therefore, is a matter of directing
this suggestibility that we all possess into the channels that
will finally produce the hypnotic state. It can be much
more complicated than this explanation in many cases, but
let us use this as a working premise.</p>

<p>Everyone can be hypnotized. The time required for
achieving hypnosis will vary from subject to subject. We
will discuss some of the reasons for this in a subsequent
chapter, but for our discussion at this time we need to
understand this point. I have encountered numerous individuals
who were extremely disappointed because they
did not respond to hypnosis immediately or after several
attempts. They wanted to know "what was wrong." An
explanation that nothing was wrong somehow did not
satisfy these individuals. "After all," they argued, "didn't
I go to a hypnotist especially to be hypnotized?" Some
insinuated that perhaps the hypnotist wasn't too good.</p>

<p>Let me explain that most subjects need to be conditioned
for hypnosis, and this conditioning is helped when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[<a href="./images/14.png">14</a>]</span>
subject practices certain conditioning exercises that I shall
discuss in detail in <a href="#chapter6">chapter six</a>, titled "How To Attain
Self-Hypnosis." In my teaching, I have found that about
one out of ten subjects responds to the first attempt at
hypnosis. One cannot make a definite statement as to the
length of time necessary to learn self-hypnosis, but it is
my experience that this usually takes about one month.
I have had subjects learn self-hypnosis in about 30 minutes,
but I must also relate that I have worked with subjects
for one year before they achieved it.</p>

<p>For the most part, the laws of learning apply to self-hypnosis
as with anything else that one would want to
learn. It can be a relatively simple procedure, or it can be
very perplexing. The answer lies not so much with the
hypnotist as with the subject.</p>

<p>One question that arises is: "If I'm under hypnosis, how
can I give myself suggestions?" During the hypnotic state,
it must be remembered, the subject is always aware of
what is going on. He hears what is said, follows directions
and terminates the state when told to do so. In the self-hypnotic
state, the subject is in full control. Therefore, he
can think, reason, act, criticize, suggest or do whatever he
desires. He can audibly give himself suggestions, or he can
mentally give himself suggestions. In either case, he does
not rouse from the hypnotic state until he gives himself
specific suggestions to do so. Many feel if they audibly
give themselves suggestions, they will "awaken." In hypno-analysis,
the subject answers questions during the hypnotic
state. Having the subject talk does not terminate the state.
You can keep the talkative subject under hypnosis as long
as you want. Furthermore, the subject can be sitting erect
with his eyes open and still be under hypnosis. Carrying
this further, the subject may not even be aware that he is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[<a href="./images/15.png">15</a>]</span>
under hypnosis. He can be given a cue not to remember
when the therapist makes a certain motion or says a certain
word that he will go back into the hypnotic state but still
keep his eyes open. Only an experienced hypnotist could
detect the change.</p>

<p>Another frequent question is: "How do I arouse myself
from the self-hypnotic state?" You merely say to yourself
that upon counting to five you will open your eyes and
wake up feeling fine. Many times the subject falls asleep
while giving himself posthypnotic suggestions. This is not
undesirable since the suggestions will spill over into the
subconscious mind as he goes from consciousness to unconsciousness.</p>

<p>A popular opinion about hypnosis is that the subject
surrenders his will to the hypnotist in the process of being
hypnotized. Furthermore, many believe that once the subject
is hypnotized, the hypnotist has complete control of
the subject and the subject is powerless to resist suggestion.
Both beliefs are erroneous. I believe the first misconception
comes from seeing techniques where the hypnotist
requests the subject to look into his eyes. The hypnotist
suggests to the subject that as he continues to look into his
eyes he will fall into a deep hypnotic state. This, then,
becomes a matter of who can outstare whom. The subject
usually begins to blink his eyes and the hypnotist follows
this up with rapid suggestions that the subject's eyes are
becoming watery and heavy and that the subject will fall
into a deep hypnotic sleep just as soon as he (the subject)
closes his eyes. This procedure gives the impression to the
observer that the subject is "willed" to go under hypnosis.
It appears that once the hypnotist concentrates or wills
sufficiently, the subject succumbs. Actually, the hypnotist
in this technique is not looking into the eyes of the subject.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[<a href="./images/16.png">16</a>]</span>
He fixes his attention on the bridge of the nose of the
subject.</p>

<p>The concept that the subject is a helpless automaton
stems from the weird movies where the "mad scientist"
has hypnotized subjects into behaving like zombies. Naturally,
there is usually a beautiful girl in the movie and she,
too, has been hypnotized. Even though the audience is
sophisticated enough to realize that this science-fiction
drama is purely entertainment, the theme is repeated sufficiently
in novels, comics, and television to make an indelible
impression on the subconscious mind. It's the technique
of telling the "big lie" so many times that it becomes
believable. We are all influenced by this procedure. There
is an excellent book explaining this very premise. It is
called <i>Battle For The Mind</i> by William Sargent. It describes
in detail the technique by which evangelists, psychiatrists,
politicians and advertising men can change your
beliefs and behavior.</p>

<p>Following the reasoning that the subconscious mind can
be affected, you can see that a problem could present itself
even though the subject consciously wishes to be hypnotized.
Unconsciously, there may be a poor interrelationship
with the hypnotist which can create an unfavorable climate
for hypnosis. When this is the case, the subject doesn't
respond until such time that he relates well to the hypnotist.
Even the most calculated procedures will fail until a
positive transference relationship is established. I am sure
that you sometimes have said, "For some reason I don't
like that person." If pressed for an answer, you'll usually
reply, "I can't explain it, but I just have a feeling about
him." Actually, your subconscious reactions are influencing
your thinking and you "feel" a certain way. The same
thing takes place in business transactions. You either like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[<a href="./images/17.png">17</a>]</span>
or dislike the proposition presented to you. You may say,
"I have a certain feeling about this deal." You may not
be conscious of the reasons, but your subconscious has
reacted automatically because of previous experience along
similar lines.</p>

<p>In giving you some insight into the hypnotic procedure,
I am trying to point out certain problems in regard to acquiring
self-hypnosis. For the most part, it is not a simple
procedure that is accomplished immediately. You can't
just will it. It requires working toward a specific goal and
following definite procedures which eventually lead to
success.</p>

<p>The hypnotist is usually endowed by the subject with an
omniscience and infallibility which logically is unjustified.
The subject is naturally extremely disappointed if he
doesn't respond immediately. If he loses confidence in the
hypnotist, he may never achieve hypnosis with this particular
hypnotist. I have hypnotized subjects who have
been to several other hypnotists without success, and I
have had some of my unsuccessful subjects hypnotized by
other hypnotists. How and why does it happen? I believe
that some of the reasons are so intangible that it would
be impossible to explain all of them with any degree of
exactitude.</p>

<p>I once saw an individual about 12 times who wanted to
learn self-hypnosis and had been unsuccessful in every
approach. I asked him if he would volunteer as a subject
for a class in techniques of hypnosis that I was teaching
for nurses. He readily volunteered and showed up at the
designated time. Much to my amazement as well as his
own, he responded within a relatively short time as one of
the nurses hypnotized him before the group. She had used
a standard eye closure technique, requesting him to look
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[<a href="./images/18.png">18</a>]</span>
at a spinning hypnodisc that I had previously used with
him every time he was in the office. Her manner was extremely
affable, she had used the identical technique I had
used unsuccessfully, and the subject responded excellently
to cap the climax. He was the first subject the nurse had
ever hypnotized, since this was only her third lesson.</p>

<p>How would you account for it? Here was one of my
students with two weeks' experience hypnotizing a subject
where I had failed while using every procedure that I felt
would work. Was it because she was a better hypnotist?
Perhaps! However, I'd like to recall at this time our discussion
about subconscious responses. I'm inclined to feel
that being hypnotized by a middle-aged female nurse
created certain favorable unconscious responses which
accounted for his going under hypnosis at that time. It
created the initial break-through which was needed. I was
able to hypnotize him easily at his next appointment, and
he acquired self-hypnosis readily from that time on.</p>

<p>I have tried the same approach with other subjects who
did not respond favorably and have failed to attain the
success that I did in the above case. Why the impasse? It
is one of the difficulties that we encounter in hypnosis,
and as yet it has not been resolved.</p>

<p>We know that the easiest way to achieve self-hypnosis
is to be hypnotized and given a posthypnotic suggestion
that you will respond to hypnosis by a key word, phrase
or gesture. I have tried to point out some problems that
can arise. Needless to say, these problems do not always
arise, and the attainment of self-hypnosis can be a relatively
simple procedure. There is usually some way of
reaching a subject who does not respond in a reasonable
length of time.</p>

<p>Now we come to the point where the subject wishes to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[<a href="./images/19.png">19</a>]</span>
hypnotize himself. What happens in this situation? It
would appear that the subject would go under hypnosis
immediately. After all, isn't he controlling the hypnotic
session? Of course, this does happen time and time again,
and the results seem miraculous. I receive mail constantly
from readers of several of my other books on hypnosis
telling me how they were able to achieve certain goals that
they never dreamed possible. They write that they have
achieved self-confidence and complete self-mastery and
have been able to overcome problems that have plagued
them for many years. These problems not only include
strictly psychological troubles but many psychosomatic
symptoms as well. Many have remarked at the ease in
which they were able to achieve self-hypnosis and the
results they wanted. For them it was as simple as following
a do-it-yourself book.</p>

<p>Others write about the difficulty they encounter and
ask what to do about it. It is my hope that this book will
shed some light for those who have experienced difficulty
in learning self-hypnosis. We shall discuss many phases
of hypnosis with the emphasis on self-hypnosis. We'll discuss
its many ramifications and try not to leave out anything
helpful in our discussion.</p>

<p>If you follow the instructions and exercises that I give
you assiduously, you should be able to achieve a depth of
self-hypnosis suitable for solving many of your personal
problems.</p>

<h3>What About the Dangers of Hypnosis?</h3>


<p>One of the objections that you hear to hypnosis is that
it can be dangerous in the hands of those not trained in
the psychodynamics of human behavior. Inasmuch as psychiatrists
and clinical psychologists are the only ones who
are thoroughly trained in the analysis of human behavior,
this objection, if valid, could limit hypnosis to a comparative
handful of therapists. Fortunately, it is not valid.
This was proved several years ago when the "Bridey
Murphy" craze gripped the country. Despite the fact that
thousands of amateur hypnotists were practicing hypnosis,
little or no harm resulted. I have personally instructed
several thousand medical and non-medical individuals
and have yet to hear of a single case where a crisis was
precipitated or anything of a dangerous or detrimental
nature occurred as a result of hypnosis. I have also taught
several thousand persons self-hypnosis and can report the
same findings.</p>

<p>Many patients who seek treatment from competent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[<a href="./images/22.png">22</a>]</span>
psychiatrists, psychoanalysts and psychologists do not always
obtain satisfactory results. This doesn't mean that
everyone should stop seeking help from these specialists.
Even a specialist doesn't have a perfect record of successful
therapy.</p>

<p>What then is the objection to hypnosis? The theory that
if you get rid of one symptom another symptom will take
its place really holds no truth and is usually advanced by
those who have had little or no experience in the hypnosis
field. However, a difference of opinion does exist even
with those practicing hypnosis in this area. Some hypnotists
"trade down" symptoms by replacing a serious symptom
with a minor one, while others just remove the
symptom. The latter is what a doctor does when he
recommends aspirin for arthritis. He knows the aspirin
will not cure the arthritis, but he wants to alleviate the
symptom. To say that another symptom will replace the
pain is unscientific&mdash;and untrue. The same is true of
hypnosis.</p>

<p>Lewis R. Wolberg, M.D., clinical professor of psychiatry,
New York Medical College, recently canvassed
30 experts in the field of hypnosis and found a few who
felt symptom removal was "irrational, temporary&mdash;or
outright dangerous." The large majority, however, "employed
symptom removal where indicated, and minimized
or ridiculed any possible bad effects."</p>

<p>A further objection to hypnosis is that the results are
temporary as well as symptomatic. It is well to remember
that most medical therapy is specifically directed to symptom
removal. How permanent is most medical treatment?
Once you couple hetero-hypnosis with self-hypnosis, you
afford the patient the opportunity of utilizing suggestions
for his own benefit any time they are needed. This,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[<a href="./images/23.png">23</a>]</span>
of course, can make symptom relief permanent. As an
example, I would see no harm in teaching a patient self-hypnosis
for symptomatic relief from a problem of
insomnia. It would certainly be better than physically
depressing the higher brain centers with sleeping pills
to produce unconsciousness every night. I needn't tell you
that millions of dollars are spent every year on sleeping
pills and patients become dependent upon them, needing
more and more pills in order to produce sleep. Many accidental
suicides stem from an overdose of sleeping pills.
Yet, despite the inherent dangers of sleeping pills which
are glaringly apparent, they are prescribed by the millions,
to say nothing of those that reach the market through
illegal channels. Furthermore, how much effort is really
made to get the patient off the sleeping pills? There are
also more voluntary suicides by sleeping pills than by any
other method. Perhaps if these drugs weren't so readily
available, many of these unfortunate individuals would
be with us today.</p>

<p>What about the often-quoted statement that "you might
do some damage"? Let's explore this area. I assume that
the reader is somewhat familiar with the work of Emile
Cou&eacute; or at least has heard of his famous autosuggestion
formula of "Day by day, in every way, I'm getting better
and better." During our time, thousands upon thousands
of seemingly helpless and hopeless cases have been cured
by repeating this affirmation over and over again, day
after day, as the individual falls asleep.</p>

<p>I think we should make it clear that whether we call it
autosuggestion, positive thinking, meditation, yoga, affirmations
or self-hypnosis, we are, in reality, talking about
the same thing. All require certain basic prerequisites before
they will work effectively for the individual. We'll
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[<a href="./images/24.png">24</a>]</span>
discuss these prerequisites in <a href="#chapter3">the next chapter</a>.</p>

<p>What should be remembered is that the suggestions are
being filtered into the subconscious mind which does not
question, doubt, analyze or dispute the efficacy of these
beneficial thoughts. You can be sure that the constant
repetition will have its effect. Hasn't the mind, in the past,
accepted the individual's diagnosis when he said, "I'm
sick," "I have an inferiority complex," "I can't stop smoking,"
"I can't lose weight," "I can't concentrate," "I can
remember a person's face, but I can't remember names,"
"I have a difficult time falling asleep," "I just can't seem
to relax." Isn't such an individual, in effect, using self-hypnosis?
And hasn't the person convinced himself of the
validity of his present state? This is truly dangerous. It is
negative hypnosis.</p>

<p>The question that I raise is: "Why shouldn't the subconscious
mind be even more convinced and respond
strongly to suggestions which are in conformity with the
natural desire to be of sound body and mind?" I have never
been able to find a logical answer.</p>

<p>I think this is what happens many times. A person seeks
help with a problem which, in reality, has nothing to do
with hypnosis. His cure is not contingent on being hypnotized
or on suggestions he or the hypnotist feel are
indicated. You will read in nearly every book and article
dealing with hypnosis that "hypnotism is not a cure-all."
No one has suggested or implied that it should be used
exclusively for all emotional problems. You may read a
newspaper article warning about the "dangers" of hypnosis.
It may tell of a person who rid himself of one symptom
and developed another in its place. You usually get a
grossly distorted picture of what happened, with many
aspects of the case not included. It's a matter of taking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[<a href="./images/25.png">25</a>]</span>
what you want to prove out of context. Propagandists use
this technique all the time to get across their message. It's
the old story of telling a half truth.</p>

<p>Honest criticism and a sincere difference of opinion are
always welcome. But criticism must be well-founded from
a scientific point of view and not stem from an emotional
reaction. You have probably heard the remark, "I won't
let anyone hypnotize me." What are they really saying,
and what does hypnosis represent to such an individual?
To them, hypnosis represents some sort of "magic spell"
which invokes a state of complete helplessness and dependency
upon the hypnotist. We previously discussed
how this erroneous conception can take place because of
the manner in which hypnosis is usually interwoven with
bizarre fictional stories.</p>

<p>For many, the hypnotic state represents a period in
which the conscious guard is dropped. They feel they may
compulsively reveal the darker side of their nature, confess
their hostility or relate information they would never
voluntarily divulge to anyone. This is the real danger they
see in hypnosis. To protect themselves from it, they attack
it. It is much like the fanatic vice crusader who militantly
attacks sin in order to alleviate his own feelings of guilt
stemming from the fact that vice actually attracts him.</p>

<p>Fear of hypnosis takes different forms, but basically it
is the fear of revealing one's true feelings. An employee,
for instance, at a gathering which included the employer
he dislikes, would never volunteer as a subject for hypnosis
if the occasion arose. He would be afraid he would
do or say something which might endanger his position.
Hypnosis for him would be "dangerous" because he
would be afraid to take the chance. The truth is, however,
that this individual would be taking no chance. The hypnotic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[<a href="./images/26.png">26</a>]</span>
state is not a confessional period. The subject is
aware at all times of what he is saying. If the subject does
not wish to pursue a line of questioning, he tells the hypnotist.
If the hypnotist persisted further along this line,
the subject would shake off the hypnotic state.</p>

<p>Another misconception about hypnosis is the widely
held belief that the subject is unconscious. This represents
a threat to the security of the individual. Actually, the
hypnotic state is a period of extreme awareness in which
the subject is hyperacute. Furthermore, the subject is not
asleep, nor is he in a trance state in the correct meaning of
that term. He is in an altered state of awareness with his
faculties and reasoning ability intact. Inducing hypnosis
merely creates a mood or state in which the powers of
suggestibility are heightened.</p>

<p>When the general public and the medical profession
become familiar with the true nature of hypnosis, we shall
have a greater acceptance and utilization of this power. It
is a slow process but one which will finally evolve. In the
final analysis, I believe the only danger that exists is in the
mind of the individual who fears hypnosis because of
whatever subjective qualms he has about his own emotional
involvement in the hypnotic process.</p>

<p>Of course, all persons using hypnosis for the alleviation
of pain should consult their family physician. Pain is
nature's way of indicating that something is wrong with
the organism. It would be foolish to suggest that a pain in
the stomach will disappear when this may be a sign of a
needed appendix operation. The same may be said of
constant migraine headaches. It must be determined that
the headache is not a symptom of a brain tumor or some
other pathological condition. It may be of interest to know
that hypnosis is presently being used to relieve pain in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[<a href="./images/27.png">27</a>]</span>
terminal cancer patients. There is an excellent article on
this subject, and I recommend it to doctors reading this
book. It is called "The Use of Hypnosis in the Case of the
Cancer Patient" which appeared in the January 1954 issue
of <i>Cancer</i>.<a name="fnanchor1" id="fnanchor1" href="#footnote1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>There are at present several thousand dentists throughout
the country using hypnosis. They have formed their
own society and publish a quarterly journal, <i>The Journal
of the American Society of Psychosomatic Dentistry</i>. One
of the best books in this field is called <i>Dental Hypnosis
Handbook</i> by Jacob Stolzenberg, D.D.S.</p>

<p>An excellent article is "Danger! Hypnotherapist at
Work" by M. Abramson.<a name="fnanchor2" id="fnanchor2" href="#footnote2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
The author reviews briefly
the pros and cons regarding the medical use of hypnosis.
He concludes: "It is the author's opinion, based on an
extensive personal experience of over 15 years, that the
use of hypnotherapy by a physician or dentist who has
been properly trained and who uses this technique strictly
within his field of competence carries with it no more
(and probably less) 'danger' than the use of many other
techniques of treatment used in medicine today."</p>

<h3>Is Hypnosis the Answer?</h3>


<p>Dr. George Estabrooks, professor of psychology at Colgate
University and author of the book, <i>Hypnotism</i>, made
the following two statements in a paper called "The
Future of Hypnosis" given as part of a program on "The
Nature of Hypnosis" at the annual meeting of the American
Psychological Association in 1959:</p>

<p>"It would be well to sound a word of caution against
certain attitudes which have become prevalent and which
can be well illustrated in the field of medicine. In this
respect, direct suggestion is under the ban. For example, a
dictum, 'Never remove the symptom unless the cause is
understood,' is much emphasized. Its validity is greatly
open to question, since much of medical practice is direct
symptom removal, as only a little thought makes apparent.</p>

<p>"Another dictum generally followed is that the unconscious
background of symptom-complexes must necessarily
be made conscious to effect a cure. Reasonable and
thoughtful consideration of the extensive role of the unconscious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[<a href="./images/30.png">30</a>]</span>
in daily living and functioning renders this
dictum much less creditable."</p>

<p>I should like to discuss both of these statements in some
detail as they invariably arise in the mind of the individual
seeking help through hypnosis.</p>

<p>The first thought that comes to mind is that all the religious
healings cited in the Bible involve direct symptom
removal. The cures that are effected by religious devotees
traveling to sacred shrines are also in the realm of direct
symptom removal. I have yet to hear a criticism of this
type of treatment directed at religious leaders or condemnation
of the religious shrines. These cures are accepted as
evidence of the power of faith or attributed to the super-natural.
In these cases, nothing is ever done to make the
person cured understand the nature of the unconscious
mechanisms which contributed to his problem.</p>

<p>Religious healing cannot be dismissed by merely saying,
"It isn't scientific." A methodology is only scientific when
it works. It is of no value if it doesn't help the individual
seeking help. We must face the fact that not all people
can be helped by the same psychological treatment. We
can readily see this in the following extreme example: An
aborigine suffering from a psychological problem certainly
wouldn't be a candidate for psychoanalysis as we know it.
He could, no doubt, be helped much more readily by a
witch doctor. It also stands to reason that the sophisticated
Westerner would not be influenced by the incantations of
a tribal medicine man.</p>

<p>Going further, we find there are many schools of psychotherapy
and many approaches to solving man's emotional
problems. The cure rate for all of them, however,
is approximately the same. I think we must accept the
fact that there is no <i>one</i> sound, logical, scientific approach.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[<a href="./images/31.png">31</a>]</span>
I believe that so long as the end result is achieved, the
methodology was scientific for that individual's needs.
The goal of all therapies is to help the patient free himself
from whatever emotional problems beset him.</p>

<p>This approach, to some readers, may seem an oversimplification
of a very complex problem, but I think it's
time that we had a simple, workable formula devoid of
technical jargon. Too often, complex technical terms and
theories have been glibly used to explain away failures.
I believe we need more and more emphasis on measures
to make the patient feel better rather than spending most
of the time trying to find out why he doesn't feel well.
This, of course, is symptom removal again.</p>

<p>I should like to point out an interesting fact pertaining
to Biblical healers. So long as the fame of the healer preceded
his arrival in any country, he was able to heal the
sick. However, where his fame as a healer was either unknown
or discredited, he found no faith and subsequently
no cure. The earliest reference to hypnosis is in the Bible,
Genesis ii, 21. "And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to
fall upon Adam, and he slept..."</p>

<p>Dr. William Malamud, 86th president of the American
Psychiatric Association, in an address delivered at the
annual meeting in 1960, stated the following in a paper
called "Psychiatric Research: Setting and Motivation":</p>

<p>"During the last few years we have witnessed a growing
trend of overemphasizing the value of 'exact' methodology
and uniformity of standards. This trend, which
could be characterized as a 'cult of objectivity,' has already
had an important influence on psychiatric research.
It is true that in its emphasis on critical judgment and
valid criteria, it has helped to curb unrestrained flights of
imagination and sloppy methodology. But the overglorification
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[<a href="./images/32.png">32</a>]</span>
of objectivity and the insistence on rigidly single
standards of acceptable methods have resulted in a concentration
on certain phases of the science of human behavior
at the expense of other very important ones."</p>

<p>I believe that most individuals have a fairly good
understanding of how they came to have the problem that
they have. I have yet to encounter the person who protests
he has no idea why he doesn't function as he would like
to in a certain area. From a practical standpoint, not many
have the time nor money required to delve into the unconscious
background of the problem. The high cost of treatment
is a very real objection and cannot be discounted
lightly. People suffering from emotional problems usually
suffer financial reverses as well. Who is to help these
people? There are very few places in the country where
they can receive competent psychiatric help at a reasonable
fee. Is there this type of help in your own community?
It is only when the individual is destitute that the
state provides whatever help it can. However, at this point
it's a long hard struggle back to good emotional health.</p>

<p>The National Association for Mental Health and its
affiliates issue about 10 million copies of 200 different
pamphlets on various aspects of mental health. To assess
the value of these pamphlets, 47 mental hygiene experts
held a conference at Cornell University. A report on this
outstanding conference has been published. It is called
"Mental Health Education: A Critique." A feature by
Ernest Havemann in the August 8, 1960 issue of <i>Life</i> contains
a very worthwhile article on this conference called
"Who's Normal? Nobody, But We All Keep On Trying.
In Dissent From 'Mental Health' Approach, Experts Decry
Futile Search For An Unreal Goal." The following
paragraph is taken from the <i>Life</i> article:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[<a href="./images/33.png">33</a>]</span></p>

<p>"What about psychiatry and psychoanalysis? This is
a different matter. Many unhappy and problem-ridden
people, though by no means all who have tried it, have
profited from psychotherapy. Indeed, all the mental health
pamphlets, as a postscript to the self-help methods they
advocate, wind up by advising the reader to seek professional
care if his problems are serious enough. But the
skeptics at Cornell cited statistics which to them show that
psychiatric treatment is as remote for the average person
as a trip to the moon. Aside from the expense, which most
people would find prohibitive, there simply are not enough
therapists to go around. The U. S. has around 11,000
psychiatrists and 10,000 clinical psychologists&mdash;in all,
about one for every 8,500 citizens. If everybody with
emotional problems decided to see a psychiatrist, the lines
at the doctors' offices would stretch for miles."</p>

<p>I assume that most readers of this book know that state
hospitals are understaffed and unable to provide proper
care for the mentally ill. Mike Gorman, executive director
of the National Mental Health Committee, has written a
crusading report on this very theme called <i>Every Other
Bed</i>. In this book he tells us that every other hospital bed
in the United States is occupied by a mental case. Mental
illness costs the country two and a half billion dollars a
year besides the more important untold human suffering
that can never be equated in dollars. The book is a shocking
story of how we have let this happen; are still letting
it happen; and of how little, for the most part, we, the
general public as well as the medical and psychological
professions, are doing to correct this deplorable situation.</p>

<p>It is time that we re-examined the dictums that say a
symptom can never be removed unless the cause is understood
and the unconscious background of symptom-complexes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[<a href="./images/34.png">34</a>]</span>
must be made conscious and understood before a
cure is effected.</p>

<p>There are many positive thinking groups functioning in
the religious field. Many of these religious groups are in
existence primarily because of the dynamic philosophy or
psychology they offer for every day living. Couple this
with a strong faith in God, and you have a combination
which approaches infallibility. Recently we have had a
series of best-selling books which expound this very theme.
Does it work? Of course it does when used properly.</p>

<p>You can be sure that there has been criticism of this
religious psychology. The criticism is that the basic causes
of the problem are never dealt with and the unconscious
conflict is not resolved. It's the same argument over and
over again. What about the people helped? They seem to
have made tremendous strides and are leading lives as
well adjusted as anyone else. Once imbued with this spirit
or feeling of well-being, it permeates every phase of their
relationships in a constructive manner. The only reason
that there isn't more criticism is that this type of psychotherapy
is incorporated into the religious tenets of these
groups, and criticizing another man's religion makes the
detractor's entire philosophy unacceptable. I am strongly
in favor of these groups because I would prefer having a
religion that keeps pointing out the positive side of life
and that "life can be beautiful" if you put your faith in
God and practice positive thinking. It is certainly better
than the cynical philosophy of its detractors or the grim
religions which stress punishment. Think of the guilt feelings
involved in the latter. No one can live up to such a
formidable creed.</p>

<p>Of course, if you suggest to positive thinking, religious
individuals that they are using a form of self-hypnosis,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[<a href="./images/35.png">35</a>]</span>
they will emphatically deny and debate the issue. Since we
are primarily interested in mental hygiene and not in winning
a debate, it is well to leave the matter as it stands.
The point to keep in mind is that so long as a person feels
that this methodology is the answer to his needs and so
long as no one is being hurt by his belief, I feel he should
cling to his conviction. He should not allow it to be destroyed
by those who are thinking in different semantic
terms.</p>

<p>I would like to bring up another common example pertaining
to the two basic concepts that we have been discussing.
It is the example of the many individuals who
have taken public speaking courses to overcome stage
fright. In most cases, the person involved hasn't had too
much opportunity to be a public speaker. Because of this,
he suddenly feels he may not say the right thing or forget
what he wants to say. This anxiety can create the very
situation or block that he fears. What is the solution?
Certainly not psychoanalysis to find out why he functions
the way he does. You could use this approach, but I don't
think it's the most constructive one. It is like asking,
"What am I doing that's wrong?" instead of "What can
I do that's right?" The most constructive approach is to
take a course of instruction to get the actual practice and
experience in the techniques of public speaking.</p>

<p>Before proceeding further, I believe it is necessary to
point out that I am not just being critical of the convictions
of other sincere and dedicated individuals engaged
in the field of mental hygiene. It is always good to re-evaluate
our present thinking on any subject, no matter
how sincere or convinced we may be that what we are
doing is correct. At times, we can become so immersed in
our convictions that we cannot take criticism and respond
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[<a href="./images/36.png">36</a>]</span>
emotionally to ideas or interpretations that do not coincide
with logical thinking.</p>

<p>What, then, is the answer to mental health problems?
There is no single answer. It is a very complex situation.
There are many promising drugs and treatments which, if
adequately developed and widely used, could do a great
deal toward promoting good mental health. Fundamentally,
the problem will always be that of trying to understand
human behavior and helping those in distress with
an efficacious formula.</p>

<p>What is that formula? I believe hypnosis can contribute
in part to the answer. Needless to say, hypnosis is contraindicated
in many emotional problems because of the
very nature of the problem itself. Some emotional difficulties
must first be worked out on a conscious level. After
this, hypnosis can be instrumental in achieving the final
goal.</p>

<p>Dr. Frank S. Caprio, a prominent psychiatrist, in his
book, <i>Helping Yourself with Psychiatry</i>, states the following:
"A whole new world of self-confidence and
positive living is open to every person, young and old,
through hypnosis, self-hypnosis and self-suggestion or
auto-hypnosis."</p>

<hr class="longer" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[<a href="./images/37.png">37</a>]</span></p>

<h2><a name="chapter4" id="chapter4"></a><i>Chapter 4</i></h2>

<h3>How Does Self-Hypnosis Work?</h3>


<p>There's an old Chinese proverb that states: "One picture
is worth a thousand words." In conveying suggestions
to the subconscious, we have found that picture images
are more effective than the words that are implanted. For
example, it isn't sufficient to say, "I will be confident."
The words must be augmented by a picture of yourself as
the confident person you want to be. If you say, "I can't
visualize myself as a confident person because I have
never been that way," you can "borrow" those personality
traits that you want for yourself. Imagine yourself endowed
with the characteristics of some confident person
that you know. The qualities that you seek may even be
borrowed from a famous person. If this isn't possible,
make up a personality which is a composite of all the
things you want to be. See yourself walking, talking and
carrying on activities. Keep fortifying this image with the
mental suggestions that are needed. It won't be long
before these mental impressions give rise to the confident
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[<a href="./images/38.png">38</a>]</span>
feelings that you seek. As you keep implanting these
images, they will become a natural part of your conscious
personality.</p>

<p>Dr. S. J. Van Pelt, president of the British Society of
Medical Hypnotists and editor of the <i>British Journal of
Medical Hypnotism</i>, writes about this technique in his
book, <i>Secrets of Hypnotism</i>. He calls it "'3-D' Technique
in Medical Hypnotherapy." As you read the following
paragraph, it would be well to remember that it contains
the essence of making the self-hypnosis technique work
once you have achieved the hypnotic state, per se. Incidentally,
the same procedure can be used in attaining the
hypnotic state itself. You see yourself entering the state
of hypnosis in your initial attempts. This, in turn, sets up
a conditioned response and a favorable emotional reaction
which is necessary.</p>

<p>"The writer has found (visualization) of the greatest
value in the re-education of the patient, which is an essential
part of hypnotherapy. In this method, after the cause
of the trouble has been discovered and as a part of his
re-education, the patient is instructed while under only
light hypnosis to 'form a picture' in his mind. He is asked
to imagine a movie screen and to see himself 'just like an
actor' on this screen playing a part. He is told that the
picture looks 'very real'&mdash;'3-D' in fact&mdash;and that he can
see himself acting and looking the way he really wants to
look and act. Various scenes are suggested such as ... the
patient will have to face in real life. In each he is instructed
to see himself&mdash;'as in real life'&mdash;always succeeding.
For instance, the stammerer might be asked to
picture himself speaking easily to people, and feeling perfectly
at ease. The patient is also instructed how to form
these 'success pictures' for himself, and it is stressed that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[<a href="./images/39.png">39</a>]</span>
he will only be able to see himself as he wants to be&mdash;successful.
Since the pictures give rise to the appropriate
feelings, it is not long before the patient begins to show
the benefit of his private '3-D' film shows."</p>

<p>After explaining this technique to students, many have
inquired, "Is that all there is to it? It seems so simple."
Of course, there is more to it in that the individual must
follow through with the instruction. This is one of the
difficult aspects of this type of program. Let me enumerate
some of the problems I have encountered in teaching self-hypnosis.</p>

<p>As mentioned, one of the difficulties is that the technique
seems too simple. Students become skeptical. They
feel it should be more complicated and involved in order
to get results. I suppose people better appreciate something
that comes only after a hard struggle. This procedure
is devoid of this. Of course, I am not saying that
once a person begins to use this technique his problems
will automatically vanish and his life will be cheery forever
after. We have been conditioned to think that success
in anything can only come after a long, hard struggle.
This is the basic theme of the American way of life. We
have been accustomed to believe that conflict and struggle
are part of life and large doses of it are necessary before
we achieve success in any field. I can only reiterate that the
information contained in this book is all you need to get
results. It is necessary that you follow through and not
give up after you have tried the program for a short while
and have obtained no appreciable results. This brings us
to another point.</p>

<p>Many persons expect immediate results when they begin
to use self-hypnosis. If they don't get the results they
anticipated immediately, they want to know "what's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[<a href="./images/40.png">40</a>]</span>
wrong?" My answer is usually that "nothing is wrong"
and that they need only keep steadily applying the instructions.
Certainly, one doesn't become a proficient typist,
musician, actor or sportsman because he has mastered the
basic techniques. It takes time to acquire proficiency.</p>

<p>Let me assure you that anyone using and applying this
technique can benefit from it. One of the troubles in dealing
with any problem is routing defeatism and hopelessness.
You can incorporate posthypnotic corrective measures
in the suggestions that you give yourself. However, I believe
that they must be dealt with on a conscious level as
well. You must believe that you can conquer your difficulties
no matter how long you have had them. If you are
prepared to work with self-hypnosis in an unremitting
manner, you will achieve the self-help that you seek. Now
and then, you can anticipate a setback in your progress,
but this needn't discourage you from your overall task.
Recount the progress already made. If you have a "let-down"
because you expected quicker and more dramatic
results, remember that this is a common feeling shared by
many with emotional problems. Remember, also, how
long you have had the problem.</p>

<p>No doubt, you have tried other methods and became
discouraged because you weren't making the progress you
had anticipated. You dropped the idea and landed back
where you started. Make up your mind, consciously, that
you will work with untiring sincerity and a perseverance
that will not falter because your chosen goal is not
achieved immediately. I know of no therapy that leads
straight to positive results without obstacles and intermittent
failure. Success comes in spite of intervening failures
because the ultimate direction has been clearly thought
out and charted. Self-hypnosis will finally work because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[<a href="./images/41.png">41</a>]</span>
you are constantly conditioning your subconscious to react
in a positive, constructive manner. The program must, of
necessity, become automatic in nature. When it does, you
will suddenly find yourself feeling the way you wanted to
and doing the things that you set out to do with the aid of
self-hypnosis. You actually cultivate those feelings that
you want.</p>

<p>Hypnosis will not work with skeptics. Every so often
such a person comes to my office seeking help. He tells me
that his family physician or his spouse feels he should take
my course in self-hypnosis. I inquire if he feels he might
benefit from the course. If his answer is not positive, and
if after talking to him at length about the benefits of hypnosis,
I still feel he is not ready for the course, I suggest
another mode of treatment for him. The reason for this is
that unless the person is optimistic and enthusiastic about
self-hypnosis, it just isn't going to work as effectively as it
would otherwise. The very nature of a skeptical attitude
limits the constructive forces that we wish to harness.</p>

<p>Occasionally, individuals want indisputable proof that
hypnosis is going to help them. It is impossible to give
them the proof and unqualified reassurance that they seek.
Yet, these same people do not require proof from their
physicians. No one can guarantee success. However, I do
point out that the continued and intelligent use of self-hypnosis
can be instrumental in directing the healing,
curative, constructive forces of nature.</p>

<p>Many times, a metaphysical rather than a scientific approach
is required. It's a matter of trying to satisfy the
patient's needs. At times, it is helpful to allow the patient
to attend a class in self-hypnosis. Being able to communicate
and identify with other individuals seeking self-hypnosis
often is enough to change his attitude. This is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[<a href="./images/42.png">42</a>]</span>
especially true when one or more of the students relates
dramatic changes.</p>

<p>Self-hypnosis works because we are able to condition
ourselves to various stimuli. We condition ourselves consciously
and unconsciously to many activities. When we
experience anxiety, it stems from a conditioning process
which could have been conscious or unconscious. In self-hypnosis,
the individual consciously works toward implementing
and strengthening his own inherent strength and
resources. These objectives, when attained, result in feelings
of confidence, relaxation, self-mastery and well-being.</p>

<p>Furthermore, hypnosis utilizes a natural mental process.
We all know that placebos work admirably in numerous
cases. The dictionary defines the word placebo as, "an
inactive substance or preparation, administered to please
or gratify a patient, also used in controlled studies to
determine the efficiency of medicinal substances." Many
controlled experiments have shown that people achieve
similar results whether they take a placebo (which they
think is the real medication) or real medication that was
prescribed. Several years ago many such tests were carried
out with antihistamines to prevent colds. The results were
always the same.</p>

<p>We are interested in what makes the placebo act as
effectively as the true medication. It stands to reason that
a chain reaction is set up, actually causing a physiological
result from a psychological reaction. The unsuspecting
patient declares, "I've never felt so good in my life." Yet,
this would never have happened if he didn't think he was
taking the marvelous new medicine. A recent scientific
study by one of the leading pharmaceutical houses concluded
that one third of the effectiveness of any medication
depends upon the faith and trust that the patient has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[<a href="./images/43.png">43</a>]</span>
in the prescribing physician.</p>

<p>I am sure that the placebo results and the patient's faith
in the physician as contributing factors to the effectiveness
of medications do not come as a revelation. We are all
aware of such information. Our problem is how to harness
this unconscious process for constructive goals. The
answer is through self-hypnosis.</p>

<p>Self-hypnosis, as we have explained it, uses a technique
called visual-imagery. This has been referred to by many
different names, but for our purposes we'll call it visual-imagery.
Within this technique lies one of the keys for
achieving the goals that you want. There have been many
famous books written incorporating this technique as a
basis for achievement. Perhaps the most famous of all is
called <i>Think and Grow Rich</i> by Napoleon Hill. In recent
years, <i>The Magic of Believing</i> by Claude M. Bristol and
<i>The Power of Positive Thinking</i>, already mentioned, have
become well-known. The book which gives direction
to most of the books in this field is called <i>Self-Mastery
Through Conscious Auto-Suggestion</i> by Dr. Emile Cou&eacute;.
I am sure the older readers of this book have heard of his
famous saying, which I will repeat here for emphasis.
"Day by day, in every way, I am getting better and better."
Invariably, in all these books, there is reference to the
Biblical quotation, "As a man thinketh in his heart, so
is he."</p>

<p>As the reader can deduce, we are not theorizing about a
startling new discovery. The technique is as ancient as
man himself and his dream of a better tomorrow. All
books using the visual-imagery technique tell you to paint
a vivid, mental picture of the material things you wish to
acquire, if it is a case of material wealth. For personal improvement,
they tell you to paint a vivid picture of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[<a href="./images/44.png">44</a>]</span>
individual you want to be. In most cases, you are told to
do this in a relaxed or meditative state with as few distractions
as possible. The next two requirements are constant
repetition (conditioning) and a "burning desire"
(motivation) to achieve what you set out to do.</p>

<p>Aren't these books really talking about self-hypnosis?
Aren't they describing precisely the techniques of self-hypnosis?
The terminology is different, but the approach
is the same. With these techniques there is an aim to direct
thinking, picturization, positive thinking, suggestions and
constructive thoughts or images to the "inner self" or
"real self." Aren't they once again really talking about
the subconscious mind? I have no argument with any
workable approach to emotional maturity, but in many
cases we are actually becoming involved with the meaning
of words (semantics). The quickest way to the subconscious
is through self-hypnosis. In this self-hypnotic state,
you are able to consciously direct suggestions to your subconscious
mind.</p>

<h2><a name="chapter5" id="chapter5"></a><i>Chapter 5</i></h2>

<h3>How to Arouse Yourself from the
Self-Hypnotic State</h3>


<p>You will note that this chapter precedes instruction on
how to attain self-hypnosis. The reason for this is to alleviate
whatever anxiety you may have in regard to the question,
"If I'm hypnotized, how do I awaken myself?" It is
important to understand that even though you are hypnotized,
you are in control, are aware of your surroundings,
what is going on about you, can think clearly and can
arouse yourself very easily. It is only necessary to say or
think, "I shall now open my eyes and wake up feeling
fine." You could also give yourself a specific count and
say, "As I count to five, I'll open my eyes and wake up
feeling wonderfully well and refreshed. One ... two ...
three ... four ... five."</p>

<p>It should be remembered that while we sometimes use
the word "sleep" to describe the hypnotic state, we are
not actually referring to true sleep. This accounts for much
of the confusion. The individual thinks, "If I'm asleep,
how can I awaken myself?" If the subject were asleep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[<a href="./images/46.png">46</a>]</span>
in the true sense of the word, this would be impossible.
Actually, the subject is in a special or heightened state of
awareness. In self-hypnosis, he is extremely conscious although
his general physical appearance is one of passiveness.
In the self-hypnotic state, the individual consciously
gives himself whatever suggestions he desires. This proves
he <i>is</i> conscious and, therefore, can awaken himself with
the appropriate suggestions.</p>

<p>Occasionally, the subject falls asleep while giving himself
suggestions or while relaxing to get into the right
psychological mood. Naturally, in this case, the subject
will awaken in due course. If the subject practices hypnosis
when he is normally set to fall asleep in bed, he would
awaken refreshed in the morning at his usual time.</p>

<p>Before beginning to give yourself therapeutic suggestions,
you could give yourself the following suggestions
which give you a <i>specific length of time</i> that you will work
with self-hypnosis:</p>

<p>"I shall work with self-hypnosis for 15 minutes. At the
end of that time, I shall open my eyes and wake up feeling
wonderfully well, wide awake, confident, cheerful and
optimistic. The moment I open my eyes, I'll feel refreshed.
In case of any outside danger, I'll be able to awaken immediately,
be fully alert and act accordingly."</p>

<p>You will notice that these suggestions take into consideration
the possibility of something happening of
danger to the individual, such as fire, etc. These points
arise in the minds of most individuals attempting self-hypnosis
and are well taken. You could also set an alarm
clock to awaken you at a designated time.</p>

<p>Let us assume to arouse yourself you gave yourself
a suggestion to open your eyes and be wide awake at
the count of five. You count to five and for some reason
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[<a href="./images/47.png">47</a>]</span>
you are unable to open your eyes. First of all, DON'T
WORRY. Remain relaxed and give yourself the suggestions
over again, emphasizing to yourself that at the count
of five you will absolutely, positively be able to open your
eyes very easily and will feel fine. You then begin the
count again reiterating between each number that you will
positively open your eyes at the count of five and be wide
awake. This should do it. Should this not do it, may I
reassure you again, DON'T BECOME ALARMED. Relax
for a few minutes and try again. You'll be able to open
your eyes and wake up.</p>

<p>I hope I haven't frightened you with the prospect of
not being able to awaken. I bring this up only to acquaint
you with the procedure to use. Actually, the problem of
dehypnotization is a rare one. I should point out a very
important fact. <i>I have never had a subject practicing or
using self-hypnosis tell me he had the least bit of difficulty
in awakening himself from the self-induced hypnotic
state.</i></p>

<p>I have had persons tell me that they heard or read of a
case where the hypnotist could not bring the subject out
of the hypnotic state, and, as a result, the subject slept for
so many days. Not one of the stories could be documented.
Years ago, for publicity purposes, stage hypnotists would
have a subject sleep in a store window for several days.
This was on a voluntary basis, though, and should not
be confused with what we are discussing.</p>

<p>In working with subjects, I have <i>very rarely</i> had a subject
who did not awaken at a specific count, but I have had
this experience. I have usually found that the subject is
so relaxed that he just didn't want to awaken for fear of
losing this pleasant sensation. When the subject doesn't
awaken, I merely ask him in a calm manner, "Why don't
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[<a href="./images/48.png">48</a>]</span>
you wish to wake up? You can answer me without awakening
from the hypnotic state." He usually replies he'd
like to remain in this state for another five minutes or so.
I agree to this extended period while getting a firm commitment
from him that he will awaken after this period.
This is usually sufficient to bring the subject out of the
hypnotic state.</p>

<p>Occasionally, the instructions to wake up are not clear
to the subject. If this is the case, clearer instructions should
be given. You could also deepen the hypnotic state and
then give suggestions to awaken at a specific count in a
very authoritarian manner. Every so often, I have found
that the subject has fallen into a natural sleep and just
hasn't heard the instructions. In this case I raise my voice
which is usually sufficient or gently shake the subject
awakening him as you would any sleeping person.</p>

<p>I would like to relate a rather interesting experience
that I had with a male subject. I had worked with this
particular subject six times previous to this occasion. He
was a good hypnotic subject, and he failed to awaken in
the usual manner. Since he had carried out several posthypnotic
suggestions, it was rather perplexing to analyze
what had happened. After about ten minutes, he finally
agreed while he was under hypnosis to awaken at a given
count. I asked him what was the nature of the difficulty.
He replied, "I wanted to see how you would react."</p>

<p>In conclusion, having difficulty in dehypnotizing yourself
is extremely rare. Should it happen, <i>keep calm</i>, and
repeat the suggestions with emphasis. Even in hetero-hypnosis,
where the hypnotist hypnotizes a subject, it is
extremely rare. There are explainable psychodynamic factors
for this. However, they can be met adequately while
the subject is under hypnosis.</p>

<h2><a name="chapter6" id="chapter6"></a><i>Chapter 6</i></h2>

<h3>How to Attain Self-Hypnosis</h3>


<p>Let us begin with the hypothesis that anyone can learn
and practice, to some degree, the science of self-hypnosis.
We shall assume that you have carefully thought out what
you want to accomplish. You have, through self-analysis,
come up with reasonable goals of therapy and self-improvement.
The next step is the acquisition of the hypnotic
state, per se.</p>

<p>Before giving you the specific instructions, I would like
to clarify a question which invariably arises in teaching
a student self-hypnosis. It is: "Are the suggestions that I
give myself as effective as the ones you would give me in
hetero-hypnosis?"</p>

<p>It is natural to assume that the suggestions of the hypnotist
would be more effective than those given by the subject
himself, but both have the same intrinsic value. It is well
to remember that all hypnosis is really self-hypnosis, and
all hetero-suggestions are transposed into self-suggestions.
If the hypnotist firmly suggests, "From this moment, you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[<a href="./images/50.png">50</a>]</span>
will feel very confident in all life situations," the subject
automatically and unconsciously rephrases the statement,
"From this moment, I will feel very confident in all life
situations." The subject, ordinarily, mentally or aloud,
repeats all suggestions using the pronoun "I" instead of
"you".</p>

<p>The easiest and quickest way to learn self-hypnosis is
to be hypnotized and given a posthypnotic suggestion to
the effect that you will be able to put yourself into the
hypnotic state at a given stimulus whenever you desire to
do so. The hypnotist need not be a professional. Anyone
understanding the rudiments of hypnosis can do this.
However, let us assume you want to learn self-hypnosis
and cannot find help. If you understand and consciously
practice the instructions that I shall outline, you will attain
your goal.</p>

<p>Sit in an easy chair or recline on a sofa or bed. Next,
choose a point of eye fixation on the ceiling, preferably a
spot behind you which would normally cause eye fatigue
or strain. Now, breathe very slowly and deeply. As you
do this, repeat, aloud or mentally, the word "sleep" as
you inhale and "deep sleep" as you exhale. Do this for
several minutes in a very monotonous manner until such
time as you find yourself getting drowsy. Next, suggest to
yourself that your eyelids are becoming heavy and tired.
The goal is to acquire eye closure using this method. You
want to reach a state where it is uncomfortable to keep the
eyes open. Once you get your eyes closing, seemingly of
their own volition, you have reached the first step in
achieving self-hypnosis.</p>

<p>You can repeat to yourself such suggestions as, "My
eyelids are becoming very heavy and tired ... My eyes are
becoming very watery ... My eyelids are blinking ... I just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[<a href="./images/51.png">51</a>]</span>
want to close my eyes ... The moment I close my eyelids, I
shall fall into a deep, sound, hypnotic sleep ... Even though
in a deep state of hypnosis, I shall be aware of my surroundings
and be able to direct posthypnotic suggestions
to my subconscious mind."</p>

<p>When your eyelids actually become heavy or when your
eyes actually begin to water, you intensify these feelings
by repeating affirmative suggestions along these very lines.
This is known as "the feed-back technique" and helps to
reinforce the actual condition that exists. Proceeding in
this way hastens the actual closing of the eyes and attainment
of the hypnotic state, per se.</p>

<p>Let us assume that you practice this procedure and
seemingly nothing happens. Continue to practice it again
and again until such time as you are able to achieve an
eye closure. You will eventually be able to do this within
a relatively short period of time.</p>

<p>One of the best times to practice the technique just
given is when you are falling asleep at night. The lights
are out and you are lying in bed. Choose an imaginary
spot above and behind your eye level so there is some
strain on the eye muscles. Now begin giving yourself
suggestions that your eyelids are becoming heavy, etc.</p>

<p>The reason this period is such an excellent time to practice
self-hypnosis is that the suggestions you give yourself
spill over into your subconscious as you drift from consciousness
to unconsciousness. It's like telling yourself to
wake up at a certain time in the morning. The suggestion
reaches your subconscious and activates you consciously
to waken. Using this approach, you can give yourself
dynamic, constructive suggestions at this time as well as
giving yourself the posthypnotic suggestion that the next
time you practice self-hypnosis, you will fall into a deeper,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[<a href="./images/52.png">52</a>]</span>
sound, hypnotic state at the count of three. You also
emphasize that your eyelids will close involuntarily whenever
you relax for five minutes and afterwards count to
three. This conditioning process will be augmented by
the use of the sleep period. The suggestions will tend to
work unconsciously during this period and hasten your
attainment of the constructive goals as well as the self-hypnotic
goal itself.</p>

<p>Once you have achieved eye closure, deepen the hypnotic
state by the following suggestions: "As I count to
three, I shall go deeper and deeper into a profound, hypnotic
state. As I count to three, I shall find myself becoming
more and more relaxed. As I count to three, I shall
fall into a deep, hypnotic sleep." You repeat these suggestions
many times, actually trying on a conscious level to
feel sleepier, more relaxed, more at ease. In doing this,
you take on the characteristics of a deeply hypnotized
subject.</p>

<p>Part of the difficulty in learning self-hypnosis is that the
subject is aiming at a state of mind in which he has no
experience. If I say, "Act happy" or "Act sad," there is an
immediate reaction from your experiential background,
and you can react accordingly. If you have never seen
anyone hypnotized and I say, "Act as though you were
hypnotized," you must, of necessity, act in a manner that
you would assume approximated that of hypnosis. If you
had actually seen someone hypnotized, you would naturally
take on the characteristics you had observed. This
would either be done consciously or unconsciously.</p>

<p>Some individuals describe the hypnotic state as a state
of "complete relaxation." Many get a feeling of "detachment;"
others a feeling of "disassociation," as though
their entire being was only thought. Some get a "floating"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[<a href="./images/53.png">53</a>]</span>
or "drifting" feeling, likening the experience to lying on
deep clouds. Others experience a heavy, pleasant, "sinking"
feeling. Still others get a feeling of "peace and
serenity." Many describe the hypnotic state as being akin
to the state just prior to falling asleep or like daydreaming,
and they experience the same reactions. Yet, there are
some who do not feel a definite change. They describe
it by saying, "I just felt that I had my eyes closed. I heard
everything and was completely aware at all times." Since
it is possible to direct your feelings (reactions), I would
suggest that you aim for a completely relaxed, comfortable
state.</p>

<p>You have now reached the point where your eyes are
closed, and you have given yourself further suggestions
to deepen the state of hypnosis. This has taken from about
six to ten minutes. You are not sure, though, that you are
under hypnosis. There are many ways to test this, and I
shall outline one of these tests later in this chapter; however,
for your initial attempts, it isn't too important
whether or not you are under hypnosis. You are still to
give yourself the posthypnotic suggestion that the next
time you attempt to hypnotize yourself you will fall into
a deeper and sounder state after you have relaxed for
about five minutes and counted to three.</p>

<p>In your initial attempts, you will be trying to establish
a conditioned response to the count of three which will
subsequently cause your eyes to close and put you under
hypnosis. Eventually, you should react instantly to the
count of three or any other cue you may use to trigger the
response. The key words or stimulus become associated
with the action that you seek. Through repetition, just
thinking about the stimulus can bring on the response.
This is known as ideomotor action and is present in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[<a href="./images/54.png">54</a>]</span>
waking as well as the hypnotic state. Pavlov's famous
experiments which induced dogs to salivate when a bell
was rung after previously having had food fed to them
at the same time are examples of this type of conditioning.
Don't we generally become hungry if someone tells
us it's noon and time for lunch when, in fact, it's only 11
o'clock?</p>

<p>I had a common experience recently that I am sure many
readers have shared. One of my neighbors, seeing my car
was parked in front of my house and knowing I was home,
called to say he was dropping in to see me. While working
on the manuscript of this book, I thought I heard the
doorbell as I was typing. I went to the front door and no
one was there. I even walked around the house looking
for him because I was so certain I heard the bell. This is
another example of an ideomotor action. I told my friend
about it when he arrived approximately 30 minutes later.
He looked at me rather whimsically, and we both shared
a laugh. Haven't you thought you heard the phone ring
when you were waiting for a call?</p>

<p>In the chapter, <a href="#chapter4">"How Does Self-Hypnosis Work,"</a> stress
was laid on the importance of the visual-imagery technique.
During every attempt to achieve self-hypnosis, you
attempt to visualize yourself going into the hypnotic state.
Once you have deepened the state, you begin the process
of visualizing yourself exactly the way you want to be.
You may experience difficulty at first, but as you keep at
it, you will be able to picture yourself the way you want.
<i>You use the visual-imagery technique whether you think
you are under hypnosis or not.</i> These images become clear
as you constantly hammer home these suggestions. This is
the exact procedure necessary, and you needn't complicate
it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[<a href="./images/55.png">55</a>]</span></p>

<p>Let us suppose that you are getting your eyelids to close
at the count of three and have achieved a good state of
relaxation. With these prerequisites, you can anticipate
going deeper into the hypnotic state. Actually, being able
to get the eyes to close at a specific count is the first test
in determining if the subject has gone under hypnosis.
If you have conditioned yourself this far, then you can go
to the next step. The next test is called the "swallowing"
test. You mentally give yourself suggestions that as you
slowly, to yourself, count to 10, you will get an irresistible
urge to swallow one time. You further suggest that this
will happen even before you reach the count of 10. You
then begin the count. "One ... My throat is parched, and
I feel an irresistible urge to swallow one time. Two ... My
lips are becoming very dry, and I feel an irresistible urge
to swallow. Three ... My throat feels very dry, and I feel
an irresistible urge to swallow one time. Four ... Before
I reach the count of 10, the urge to swallow one time will
become irresistible because my lips and throat are so dry.
Five ... Once I swallow, I shall no longer have the urge
to swallow again, and as I swallow one time, I shall fall
into a deeper and sounder state of hypnosis." Continue
with similar suggestions, repeating and affirming the suggestions
about swallowing. Once you actually swallow,
you discontinue the suggestions and, instead, give yourself
suggestions that you are falling deeper and deeper into
a sound hypnotic state and that the constructive suggestions
you now give yourself will work for you. Once again
you practice visual-imagery, seeing yourself the way you
want to be, while fortifying this image with forceful,
positive suggestions. You close by giving yourself suggestions
that you will enter the hypnotic state whenever
you relax for five minutes and count to three.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[<a href="./images/56.png">56</a>]</span></p>

<p>The suggestions are just as effective whether given aloud
or mentally. Many subjects report that they are reluctant
when it comes to giving suggestions to themselves. I can
only say that as you continue to work with yourself, you
will develop confidence in giving yourself suggestions.
In order for the suggestions to be effective, they cannot
be given in a reticent or hesitant manner. They must be
given with enthusiasm and anticipation. If you assiduously
follow these instructions, you will derive the benefits you
seek in the shortest possible time and witness the positive,
tangible results of your suggestions and efforts. In the next
chapter, you'll learn how to deepen the self-hypnotic state.</p>

<h2><a name="chapter7" id="chapter7"></a><i>Chapter 7</i></h2>

<h3>Deepening the Self-Hypnotic State</h3>


<p>For each progressive test, it is usually necessary to have
accomplished the preceding tests. However, this is not an
absolute rule. Frequently, a subject responds to tests at the
beginning of the depth scale and then to others at the end
of the depth scale. Certain tests in between do not work.
I have had the following experience more than once while
teaching one of my classes in self-hypnosis. In testing the
depth of hypnosis, I run the gamut of all of the tests from
light to deep. In this way, the subject can ascertain how
far he has progressed. One frequent test for the deep state
is to give the subject a posthypnotic suggestion to the
effect that the next cigarette he smokes will have a vile
taste and it will be absolutely impossible for him to take
more than three puffs. It is further suggested that after the
third puff, the cigarette taste will be so unbearable it will
become necessary for him to extinguish the cigarette.</p>

<p>We can expect an excellent hypnotic subject to comply
with these posthypnotic suggestions, but a subject who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[<a href="./images/58.png">58</a>]</span>
hasn't even passed the eye closure test (test No. 1) or any
other test may unexpectedly react perfectly to the cigarette
test which we know is a standard test for determining if
the subject has entered into a deep state of hypnosis. How
can you account for it? There is no simple or positive
answer. If we hadn't given him this particular test, he
would have felt that he wasn't making progress in his
determination to become a good hypnotic subject. Because
of this, he might not have given himself therapeutic suggestions
because he would feel he hadn't reached a state
of hypnosis which would benefit him. Remember, follow
the instructions of giving yourself whatever therapeutic
suggestions you want, regardless of the fact that you feel
that "nothing has happened." I have seen many subjects
who were bewildered because certain tests did not work,
yet were pleased because of very gratifying overall results
from using self-hypnosis. They were baffled because of
their inability to pass certain tests which they felt were a
prerequisite to the success of constructive suggestions they
gave themselves.</p>

<p>It is commonly felt that the deeper the state of hypnosis,
the better the results. In actual practice, I have not found
this to be so. I have had excellent results in a relatively
short period of time with subjects who only achieved a
light state, and it has been necessary to work with others
who achieved a deep state of hypnosis for a longer period
before lasting results were in evidence. Naturally, each
individual presents a different set of needs and even
though the symptoms may be basically the same, each
will respond favorably when his requirements are met.
This happens on a conscious as well as unconscious level.
For example, the mere assurance by a physician that the
patient is all right and has nothing to worry about is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[<a href="./images/59.png">59</a>]</span>
often sufficient to bring about desirable results. Another
example is the mother who stops the sobbing of her hurt
child by a loving kiss. A logical approach, pointing out
to the child that he really didn't hurt himself, would never
have worked. We have all heard stories of primitive tribesmen
who have died because they knew they were the objects
of "death wishes" by another member of the tribe.</p>

<p>The key to achieving a greater depth of self-hypnosis
lies in the use of the visual-imagery technique. You "see"
yourself going into the hypnotic state deeper and deeper.
You even picture yourself, using this technique, passing
various progressive hypnotic tests. The second part of the
key lies in giving yourself a posthypnotic suggestion that
each succeeding attempt will put you into a deeper state
as a result of a given stimulus&mdash;such as the count of three.</p>

<p>The following instructions should not be attempted
usually unless you have been successful in achieving the
two basic tests&mdash;the eye closure as well as the uncontrollable
urge to swallow followed by the physical act of
swallowing at a specific count. If the conditioning process
works for these two tests, you have achieved the lethargic
state of hypnosis. This is the first state of hypnosis and is
generally referred to as the "light" state. Therapeutic
suggestions can work admirably in this state. The next
stage of hypnosis is known as the cataleptic state and is
referred to as the "medium" state. Generally, hypnosis is
divided into three states: the lethargic (light state); the
cataleptic (medium state); and the somnambulistic (deep
state).</p>

<p>As you deepen the hypnotic state, you can accomplish
the progressive tests that I shall outline for you. I'll also
number these tests for the convenience of having a reference.
Deepening the hypnotic state requires the same type
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[<a href="./images/60.png">60</a>]</span>
of practice or conditioning as the first two steps. Let us
call eye closure&mdash;No. 1, and swallowing&mdash;No. 2. We
are now ready to proceed to the "hand tingling" test&mdash;No.
3.</p>

<p>You have just completed tests No. 1 and 2; you are in
a completely relaxed state. Now give yourself the following
suggestions: "As I count to ten and even before I
reach the count of ten, I shall feel a light tingling or numb
feeling in my right hand." As you slowly begin the count
of ten, you keep repeating suggestions to the effect that
your right hand is beginning to tingle. Once again, you
practice the technique of visual-imagery, tapping your experiential
background for this feeling. You can recall how
it feels when your hand goes to sleep. Once you get an
initial feeling of lightness, tingling or numbness, reinforce
this feeling by the feed-back technique as you did with the
eye closure test. As you practice this procedure, it will
work with greater effectiveness. The following is a very
important point to remember. Be sure that you give yourself
a posthypnotic suggestion that the tingling, light or
numb sensation will disappear as you continue to count
to 15. For example, "As I count to 15, the tingling feeling
in my right hand will disappear, and I shall experience
only normal sensations. Eleven ... The tingling feeling is
leaving. Twelve ... Now it is leaving faster. Thirteen ... I
can feel my hand returning to normal. Fourteen ... The
tingling feeling has left. Fifteen ... My right hand feels
perfectly normal." You could try a variation of this test
by saying your nose or one of your toes will itch at a
specific count. Once this test is accomplished, you are
ready for the "foot" test&mdash;No. 4.</p>

<p>You will remember that the key to achieving a greater
depth of hypnosis lies in visualizing yourself going deeper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[<a href="./images/61.png">61</a>]</span>
with each attempt and accomplishing progressive hypnotic
tests. Keep this in mind. For a moment, let us go back to
the hand tingling test&mdash;No. 3. Once you have been successful
in accomplishing this test, use the visual-imagery
technique to see yourself successfully responding to the
foot test. When you have actually accomplished test No.
4, you see yourself accomplishing the "hand levitation"
test&mdash;No. 5. In other words, you use each step to enhance
a greater receptivity for the following progressive test.
As you couple this approach with posthypnotic suggestions
that you will go deeper and deeper into the hypnotic
state at a given stimulus, you set into motion a conditioned
response mechanism which must ultimately guide
you into a profound state of hypnosis.</p>

<p>The foot test can be accomplished while sitting or lying
down. The idea of this test is to imagine that your feet are
stuck to the floor or that your legs are so heavy that they
are impossible to raise until you reach a certain count.
It is best to begin this test by trying to capture a heavy,
relaxed feeling in your legs. You give yourself specific
suggestions along these lines: "As I count to five, I shall
notice a very heavy, relaxed, pleasant feeling in both legs.
It will be a very comfortable feeling; a feeling of complete
relaxation." You then begin the count of ten, following
out the idea of the other tests you have successfully
accomplished. You should remember that there is no time
limit and you take as much time as you need in order to
get the relaxed, heavy feeling. Once you get the relaxed,
heavy feeling, you use the visual-imagery technique to try
to picture your legs stuck to the floor. If you are lying
down, imagine you are covered by a heavy blanket which
is tightly tucked under the mattress, making it impossible
for you to raise your legs. If sitting up, I tell the subject
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[<a href="./images/62.png">62</a>]</span>
to imagine that his shoes are stuck to the floor with "iron
glue," and since his feet are in the shoes, it is impossible
to lift them until the specific count which will enable him
to do so.</p>

<p>Here are the suggestions you can use for the second
part of this test. "As I continue to count to ten, I shall find
that it will be impossible for me to raise my legs. I shall
try at the count of ten, but it will be absolutely impossible
to raise my legs until I count to 15. At that time, I shall
be able to raise my legs easily, and the heavy feeling will
leave as well." You then continue with the count, giving
yourself appropriate suggestions. Once this test is accomplished,
you use the visual-imagery technique to see yourself
accomplishing the hand levitation test&mdash;No. 5. Be
sure you give yourself the posthypnotic suggestion that
the next time you hypnotize yourself, you will fall into a
deeper and sounder state.</p>

<p>I'll assume that you have been able to get a relaxed,
heavy feeling in your legs. You have reached the count of
five and are ready to proceed further. Here are sample
suggestions you can use: "Six ... My legs are becoming
extremely heavy. Seven ... I'll be unable to lift them until
I count to 15. Eight ... I feel very comfortable; my legs
are becoming heavier and heavier. Nine ... My entire body
is completely relaxed, and my legs are so heavy that they
are impossible to lift. Ten ... I'm in a very deep hypnotic
state, and it is absolutely impossible for me to move my
legs until I count to 15." At this point, you actually try to
raise your legs. If you can't do it, you have reached the
cataleptic stage.</p>

<p>Should you not be able to raise your legs, don't become
frightened. All you need to say is: "I can now move my
legs." You could also say: "As I count to three, I'll be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[<a href="./images/63.png">63</a>]</span>
able to move my legs." However, since we have elected
originally to be able to move the legs at the count of 15,
it would be best to follow out this pattern. You could at
this time merely continue to count to 15, at which time
you would be able to move your legs. I prefer giving suggestions
between each count as follows: "Eleven ... The
heavy feeling is leaving, and I shall be able to raise my
legs at the count of 15. Twelve ... I can feel the heavy,
relaxed feeling leaving. Thirteen ... I am beginning to
move my legs. Fourteen ... I am lifting my legs more and
more. Fifteen ... I have perfect control over my bodily
functions and legs; I am lifting and moving my legs;
the heavy feeling is dissipating; I am in complete control;
I can now give myself posthypnotic suggestions that will
be very effective and beneficial." Give yourself whatever
suggestions you want at this time.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that you tried the foot test for some
time and were unsuccessful. Perhaps this puzzles you, and
you wonder why it didn't work. Perhaps you were able to
get a heavy feeling in the legs, but the second part of the
test didn't work. The following information will help you
to understand why you were unable to complete this cataleptic
test. Either you had not conditioned yourself sufficiently,
or you weren't really "letting go" enough to enter
into a deeper state of hypnosis. Most subjects need to test
themselves and feel secure every step of the way. They
don't just plunge into the cataleptic or somnambulistic
stages immediately. In this connection, I believe it can be
compared with the bather who goes into the water one
step at a time. Even the playful splashing directed at him
by friends does not compel him to duck under the water.
Instead, he continues to slowly go deeper and deeper
until he is completely submerged. Wouldn't it have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[<a href="./images/64.png">64</a>]</span>
easier to duck under all at once? Perhaps, but I'm sure you
have either experienced the same thing yourself or seen it
happen.</p>

<p>The analogy should be clear. The subject is reluctant to
do what he considers as "giving up his control" when, in
reality, he is really more and more in control of himself as
he penetrates the deeper levels of hypnosis.</p>

<p>In reality, the subject who does not or cannot raise his
feet really could move in case of emergency, even without
counting to 15. He has, in effect, entered into a state in
which it is too much bother to lift his feet. A common
example of this frame of mind is when you remain in bed
in the morning even though you know you will be late to
work. You are just too comfortable to move, and your
initiative seems paralyzed.</p>

<p>Let us assume, at this point, that you have finally succeeded
in getting the foot test to work. You are now ready
for the hand levitation test&mdash;No. 5. In this test, the goal
is to get your hand to slowly rise and touch your chin.
Once it touches your chin, you enter into a still deeper
state and lower your hand slowly to your side. This test
is actually combined with the hand tingling test&mdash;No. 3.
Since you have been successful with test No. 3, the rest is
rather simple. This time as you work test No. 3, aim for a
light, pleasant feeling in your right hand. Once you get
this reaction, you give yourself suggestions that your right
hand will now rise and touch your chin. As soon as it does,
you will fall into a deeper state and lower your hand.
Here are the suggestions that you can use: "As I count to
ten and even before I reach the count of ten, I shall have
an irresistible impulse to slowly raise my hand to my chin.
As I progress with the counting, my hand will slowly rise,
and the impulse will become stronger and stronger. As
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[<a href="./images/65.png">65</a>]</span>
soon as my hand touches my chin, the impulse will leave.
I will then lower my hand and fall into a very deep hypnotic
state. I shall be fully aware of what is happening,
my surroundings, and will be able to give myself beneficial
posthypnotic suggestions."</p>

<p>At this point you start counting to ten, giving yourself
suggestions that your right hand which already has a light
feeling will begin to slowly rise to your chin. Time the
counting to coincide with the actual physical act of raising
your hand. You are trying to feel an involuntary urge to
raise your hand. The movement itself should also be of an
unconscious rather than conscious nature. A conscious raising
of your hand to your chin is not what you are looking
for in this test. Should you experience difficulty in attaining
the first movement of your hand, you can give yourself
assistance by consciously and slowly raising your hand just
to get it started. The rest of the movement, as mentioned,
must be automatic. Should you find it necessary to start
your hand rising, use the feed-back technique to continue
the movement. You can give yourself the following suggestions:</p>

<p>"One ... My right hand is beginning to rise. Two ... My
right hand is very, very light, and I am getting an irresistible
urge to slowly raise it. Three ... This feeling is getting
stronger and stronger. Four ... My right hand is rising
more and more. Five ... My hand is rising toward my chin.
Six ... As soon as my hand touches my chin, I shall fall into
a deeper and sounder state of hypnosis. Seven ... My hand
is rising closer and closer toward my chin. Eight ... The
feeling of lightness is becoming stronger and stronger.
Nine ... My right hand is about to touch my chin; as soon
as it does, I'll fall into a very deep hypnotic state. Ten ...
My right hand is touching my chin; I'm falling deeper and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[<a href="./images/66.png">66</a>]</span>
deeper into a sound hypnotic state; I'll now slowly lower
my hand and continue falling into a deep, sound, pleasant
state of hypnosis. The light feeling has left my hand."</p>

<p>You should not attempt to memorize the exact phraseology
for any of the tests. You are to merely use the suggestions
that have been written out for you as a guide.
The timing of the suggestions is the paramount consideration
in attaining successful results. Don't be impatient.
Take as much time as you need. Should you find yourself
unsuccessful after ten or fifteen minutes, drop the test and
come back to it another day. I haven't found that working
at a specific test all day long accomplishes the end result.</p>

<p>It is best to work for a specific period every day. In this
way, the conditioned response pattern is established for
the success of the tests as well as the success of the posthypnotic
suggestions that you have given yourself. You
should bear in mind that if you have been successful in
achieving the first five tests, you have reached a medium
state of hypnosis, and posthypnotic suggestions will be
extremely effective. In the next chapter, you'll learn, psychologically,
how to go even deeper into hypnosis. You'll
learn those psychological factors that are important to
know and that can contribute to your development into an
excellent hypnotic subject. Following this, <a href="#chapter9">the subsequent
chapter</a> will give you further tests and instructions for
developing into a somnambulistic subject.</p>

<h3>What You Should Know About Becoming
An Excellent Subject</h3>


<p>Becoming an excellent subject follows the same general
rules for becoming proficient in any other endeavor. It
depends upon your motivation, persistence and willingness
to devote time and study to the subject. Let us agree
that most individuals can learn to play a musical instrument
to some degree. This degree is usually sufficient for
their own needs. To become a virtuoso, however, it is
necessary to study the instrument and devote a great deal
of energy and time to practice. The same example could
be given for most undertakings. Anyone can learn to hit
a golf ball, but being able to control the direction and
distance and become a skilled golfer is quite another
matter.</p>

<p>If you have been successful in accomplishing the first
five tests, you can consider yourself a good hypnotic subject.
Becoming an excellent subject entails following the
same procedure used in accomplishing the first five tests.
Some may proceed very easily into the somnambulistic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[<a href="./images/68.png">68</a>]</span>
state, and others may have a difficult time reaching this
deepest stage. Understanding some of the psychology involved
and assuming the right psychological frame of
mind for the attainment of the somnambulistic state is
more important than just working blindly in an attempt
to get the somnambulistic tests to work. Being irritable,
disgusted and despondent because of your inability to go
further into hypnosis is not the answer and will only lead
to frustration and failure. The reader is not to assume he
will be a difficult subject. If you have come this far, you'll
be able to continue in the same manner. The topic under
discussion now is brought up to prepare readers for any
contingency that may arise. It's like having a life preserver
on a boat. You hope you never need it, but you should
be prepared to use it in case of an emergency.</p>

<p>It is natural to assume that if you are willing and trying
to go into the lethargic, cataleptic or somnambulistic state,
you will be able to do so in a relatively short period of
time. Unfortunately, this is by no means the case. Many of
the principles of learning and conditioning can be applied
to hypnosis, but with many subjects these laws do not
seem applicable. Let us assume you wanted to learn to
become an excellent typist. This is a reasonable goal and
all that is necessary is to continue practicing until you
have reached the proficiency you set out to achieve. This
proficiency would, as a rule, follow application of the
laws of learning and conditioning.</p>

<p>This isn't always so in a subject's attempt to become
somnambulistic. When the subject progresses from one
stage to another in a classical manner, the theory works
admirably, but what happens when a subject cannot seem
to progress any further? He has reached a plateau and is
unable to climb higher. He seems to have reached a psychological
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[<a href="./images/69.png">69</a>]</span>
impasse or stalemate. It is easy to say that the
subject is thwarted by a subconscious block and let it go
at that. This, however, doesn't help him in his dilemma.
It's like telling the stranded motorist that the reason his
car has stalled is because the motor isn't running. The following
information will be helpful to those who haven't
been able to reach the first stages of hypnosis, as well as
those who apparently can go only so far. Actually, the
same principles are involved.</p>

<p>If the subject doesn't respond or responds to a limited
degree, there evidently is a cause or reason for this poor
response. In order to continue this discussion, it will be
necessary for us to agree that the resistance can be either
conscious or unconscious. If the subject insists that he is
trying to "let go," has nothing to hide, is not afraid of
hypnosis, understands what is involved and has strong
motivation, we can only assume that the resistance must
be unconscious. Usually, it will be necessary to work
through this unconscious resistance before the subject
responds. If the subject is conditioning himself, this will
involve a great deal of introspection, and even then it is
an extremely difficult job. One doesn't usually have proper
insight into one's own emotional make-up. The end result
is that one can only rationalize about his behavior.</p>

<p>Let us explore some interesting aspects of hypnosis with
a view toward helping you if you are having difficulty
responding the way you desire. I have had the following
paradoxical situation happen many times. A subject calls
my office, requesting to be conditioned for self-hypnosis.
He further requests that he be allowed to bring along a
member of his family or a friend for the hypnotic session.
These individuals usually ask if I object to this procedure.
I interpreted this request as a sign of distrust during my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[<a href="./images/70.png">70</a>]</span>
early career as a professional hypnotist. I was affronted by
the idea of the unspoken insinuation verbalized by this
request. Didn't they trust me? Between trying to defend
myself and assuring them that there was no need for
another person being present, since my secretary could
observe the procedure, I usually "won" the argument but
lost the client. As I developed understanding into the
needs of these persons, I began to realize that the request
was not directed at my integrity, but was a safeguard for
their ego.</p>

<p>Here is an interesting sidelight that has happened frequently
in regard to the foregoing situation. I would request
the subject to sit near my desk and tell the onlooker
to sit in back and to the side of the subject, away from the
subject's view so as not to distract him. In this situation, I
invariably place the hypnodisc on a spinning, portable
phonograph turntable and turn it upright for the subject
to look at. The hypnodisc, which is made of stiff cardboard,
looks like a 12-inch phonograph record and has
concentric heavy lines drawn on it. As it spins, the subject
feels he is being pulled toward the center. At the same
time, it causes his eyes to become very tired. I have included
a drawing of it on this page for those who are not
familiar with this hypnotic device. The revolving hypnodisc
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[<a href="./images/71.png">71</a>]</span>
causes a physiological reaction and must work with
everyone. You feed back certain known physiological
responses for the successful attainment of hypnosis.</p>

<div class="centre">
<img src="images/130-illus-1.png"
alt="hypnodisc"
title="hypnodisc" />
</div>

<p>The onlooker has no choice but to look at the hypnodisc
as well. As I suggest to the subject that his eyes are becoming
heavy and tired and that soon he'll have an irresistible
impulse to close them, the onlooker is naturally
hearing the same suggestion. Because this person feels
apart from the hypnotic situation, there can be no conscious
resistance. Since these defenses are not hampering
the attainment of hypnosis, the onlooker may readily fall
under hypnosis. More than once, the onlooker has confided
to me that he was getting a better night's sleep, was
feeling wonderfully well or had derived other benefits
since coming to my office as an "observer." The exact
situation happens when the stage hypnotist is hypnotizing
subjects on the stage. Many times a person in the audience
who had no intention of becoming hypnotized becomes
influenced in the same manner. Incidentally, these individuals
make the best subjects.</p>

<p>There are interesting theories as to why a subject responds
or does not respond to hypnosis. I think the reader
would find some of these theories interesting and perhaps
gain some insight into his own hypnotic behavior. These
theories are based primarily on a psychoanalytical approach
to hypnosis.</p>

<p>The most prevalent theory is that the hypnotist represents
either the father image (paternal or fear hypnosis)
or the mother image (maternal or love hypnosis). The
father usually represents an authoritarian figure. The
subject's identification can be on a conscious or subconscious
level. Let us suppose the subject has ambivalent
feelings toward his father. Because of this, he may not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[<a href="./images/72.png">72</a>]</span>
respond. Here is an opportunity to frustrate the authoritative
(father) figure. The only trouble with this theory
is that if there is an excellent relationship between the
father and subject, it doesn't necessarily mean that the
subject will respond easily. The stage hypnotist invariably
uses a strong, authoritative approach with a great deal of
success, but this approach generally does not work best in
private practice.</p>

<p>I have found that for the majority of subjects the
maternal approach works best. Perhaps the process of
hypnosis awakens early unconscious memories of being
put to sleep as a child. Some techniques that are used in
hypnosis are quite similar to this. The subject, who is
lying down, is told to close his eyes and is spoken to in a
quiet, reassuring, monotonous tone of voice. The hypnotist
is seated near him. The hypnotist even uses the same
words that the subject has heard as a child: "Sleep. Go to
sleep. When you awaken, you'll feel wonderfully well."
In fact, I use some special music that I had recorded for
inducing hypnosis. The first musical selection is Brahms'
"Lullaby." Children's music boxes invariably contain this
selection, and the melody cannot help but activate a pleasant
nostalgia. It is a memory associated with love and
tenderness. This brings us to the fact that hypnosis may
offer the subject a chance to escape from the reality of
pressing problems into a state of complete irresponsibility.
In fact, one theory of hypnosis equates the hypnotic state
as a form of unconscious regression and need for submission.</p>

<p>The male subject may have a strong, positive identification
with his mother rather than his father. It is part of
the unresolved Oedipus complex. He sees his mother as a
kind, loving individual, always ready to help. Even if the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[<a href="./images/73.png">73</a>]</span>
mother did something socially unacceptable, the individual
would defend her vehemently. The father who
might do something wrong would rarely be excused. Just
the opposite is true with the female subject. When asking
the female child, "Whose girl are you?", the answer is
invariably, "Daddy's girl." When asking the male child,
"Whose boy are you?", the answer is invariably, "Momma's
boy." We accept this transference of identification as
a normal process of growing up. When it isn't normally
resolved, it can account for severe personality problems.
One might assume, therefore, that a woman hypnotist
could better hypnotize a male subject, and a male hypnotist
could better hypnotize a female subject, but this is
not true except for cases such as we have just mentioned.</p>

<p>One school of thought feels that there is a strong submissive
tendency in all of us and hypnosis gratifies this
wish. The individual's need for dependence is also met.
In this case, the hypnotist becomes omnipotent, being able
to alter feelings that ordinarily distress the individual.
Normally, adults, when confronted by a particularly upsetting
experience, might want to be held closely by an
intimate friend or member of the family. Don't we frequently
put our arm around a friend in grief trying to
comfort him? The inner strength which is created by
hypnosis within the total personality structure of the
subject lessens dependency upon the hypnotist, much in
the same fashion that we need the doctor less as we start
to recover from an illness. Self-hypnosis further lessens
dependency for no authoritarian figure is used.</p>

<p>The subject's attitude towards authority is important to
know. It is well-known that officers in the army are more
difficult to hypnotize than noncommissioned men. The
enlisted man, by a process of indoctrination and conditioning,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[<a href="./images/74.png">74</a>]</span>
is taught to obey and follow orders without
reasoning. The transference of authority to the hypnotist
is readily accomplished because of this conditioning
process. The army doctor, when treating patients psychologically,
replaces his army jacket with a regular white
medical jacket to increase rapport.</p>

<p>One interesting theory is that the subject responds as
he thinks the hypnotist would like him to. This is termed
"role playing." When asking a subject under hypnosis
his name, you usually get a very slow, deliberate answer,
as though the subject were in a trance. You tell him that
he can answer in a normal speaking voice and tempo and
his further replies are to be in the same manner as his
waking state.</p>

<p>Another theory along these lines is that the subject acts
as he believes a hypnotized person would act. This, too, is
role playing, but it does not explain analgesia, such as
when the dentist hypnotizes the patient and proceeds to
drill a tooth. No one (with the possible exception of a
highly neurotic psychic masochist) is going to endure
excruciating pain just to please the doctor.</p>

<p>One theory about hypnosis states that it allows the
subject an opportunity of identifying with the hypnotist,
whom he sees as a powerful figure. Through this identification,
the subject is able to gain inner strength. On the
other hand, the subject might rebel against the submissive
nature of the hypnotic setting. This could easily create
anxiety which, in turn, could create hostility resulting in
resistance of various kinds. As a result of this, the subject
might begin to criticize the hypnotist, find fault with the
way he (the subject) is being handled, question the judgment
of the hypnotist, or doubt the effectiveness of the
hypnotic procedure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[<a href="./images/75.png">75</a>]</span></p>

<p>Many investigators assert that the "rapport," meaning
the relationship between the subject and hypnotist, is all
important. This is true and the relationship can and does
have many ramifications. In psychotherapy, the term
"transference" is used to denote this relationship. The
relationship is further described as a good or bad transference.
There is also a countertransference which indicates
the reaction of the therapist to the patient. Naturally,
in order for the subject to respond, there must be
good rapport.</p>

<p>I have tried to indicate that there are complexities that
may arise in the hypnotic setting. There are many conflicting
theories as to why a subject does or does not
respond. There are no set rules to follow, and one's intuition,
experience and judgment help solve any problem
that arises.</p>

<p>Let me relate another frequent incident. I have had
subjects come to me after they were unable to be hypnotized
by several other professional hypnotists. They have
complained that the hypnotists weren't "good hypnotists"
because they couldn't hypnotize them. After all, they ask,
hadn't they been willing subjects? My usual answer is
that the fault, if there is one, is not with the hypnotists
and really not with the subjects. It is a matter of exploring
what has happened and then deciding on a course of
action to insure success.</p>

<p>I am firmly convinced that the subject responds when
he is positively, without equivocation, ready to do so. He
keeps testing the response to make sure he is in control.
He fears a reduction in his voluntary level of reality attachment
and control. Unresponsiveness proves to him
that he has this control. As long as he does this, which is
a natural response, he never lets go sufficiently to attain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[<a href="./images/76.png">76</a>]</span>
hypnosis. Hypnosis, as we know, is a very sensitive state.
It requires complete faith and trust in the hypnotist. If it
is lacking, the subject never does respond. The phenomenon
of hypnosis is entirely subjective in nature, and its
success lies within the total personality structure of the
subject. If there is resistance to hypnosis itself or to deepening
the state, the subject by his own honest evaluation
and verbalization of his resistance can do much to become
a better subject. Hypnosis must begin with the acceptance
by the subject of certain basic fundamentals that we have
already discussed rather than of the forcefulness of the
hypnotist. The deepening of the hypnotic state lies in the
intensification of the conditioned response mechanism
once it has been initiated.</p>

<p>You should not expect to achieve immediate results
although sometimes this does happen. As you continue
to work with perseverance, intelligence and enthusiasm,
you will definitely achieve the goals that you have set for
yourself. It is well to remember that you guide yourself
toward the somnambulistic state, depending upon your
belief and acceptance of those principles that have been
outlined for you.</p>

<p>I have attempted to point out some of the salient points
and theories to keep in mind in your attempt to develop
into an excellent hypnotic subject. Some of these only pertain
to the situations where the hypnotist works with the
subject. Many of the problems inherent in this setting are
not applicable to the situation where the subject is hypnotizing
himself. Both settings have their advantages and
disadvantages. As long as you proceed to follow the instructions
given you, you can feel assured that you will
finally achieve self-hypnosis.</p>

<p>It should be emphasized that it is vital to adopt the right
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[<a href="./images/77.png">77</a>]</span>
frame of mind in your attempt to achieve self-hypnosis,
particularly a deep state. If you approach hypnosis with a
"prove-it-to-me" attitude, nothing is going to happen.
Self-hypnosis requires practicing a set of mental exercises
or mental gymnastics. To acquire the ultimate from this
training requires systematic conditioning. The word "training"
is used quite extensively in hypnotic literature. The
use of the word implies that hypnosis can be attained by
a training period. The literature speaks frequently of a
subject being trained to respond in a certain way. Obviously,
this means over a certain period of time. It also
means you train yourself to become a good hypnotic subject.
It is a skill that all can acquire.</p>

<p>There are four books dealing specifically with self-hypnosis
that I would recommend to you for further
reading. They are: <i>What is Hypnosis</i> by Andrew Salter,
<i>Hypnosis and Self-Hypnosis</i> by Bernard Hollander, M.D.,
<i>Autogenic Training</i> by Johannes H. Schultz, M.D., and
<i>Self-Hypnosis&mdash;Its Theory, Technique and Application</i>

<h3>Techniques for Reaching the
Somnambulistic State</h3>


<p>As indicated in <a href="#chapter8">the last chapter</a>, the attainment of the
somnambulistic stage of hypnosis can represent an extremely
intricate procedure. Because of certain inherent
characteristics of this stage, it is easier to attain by hetero-hypnosis.
However, this does not preclude the fact that
it can be reached without the aid of a hypnotist. More
important than the testing and deepening procedures that
I shall outline for you in this chapter are an <i>understanding</i>
and an <i>awareness</i> of some of the complexities involved,
first in achieving the hypnotic state, then deepening, and,
finally, reaching somnambulism. There are no absolute
or final answers to many of the problems that can arise.
You can become entangled with rationalization so easily
when you want the facts to fit a particular theory. I point
this out to the reader because, as the subject goes deeper,
the procedure can become more complicated.</p>

<p>There are many interesting phenomena which can be
elicited in the somnambulistic state. They are of interest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[<a href="./images/80.png">80</a>]</span>
for the most part, to students of abnormal behavior and
are pertinent from an academic viewpoint. They do not
fall within the province of this book or of hypnosis for
therapeutic purposes and might lead the reader astray.
Should readers be interested in further hypnotic phenomena,
I refer them to <i>Modern Hypnosis</i> by Leslie Kuhn
and Salvadore Russo, Ph.D., <i>Experimental Hypnosis</i> by
Leslie LeCron, <i>Time Distortion in Hypnosis</i> by Milton
Erickson, M.D. and Lynn F. Cooper, M.D., and <i>Hypnotism&mdash;An
Objective Study in Suggestibility</i> by Andr&eacute; M.
Weitzenhoffer, Ph.D.</p>

<p>As discussed previously, some individuals experience
difficulty in attaining the deeper hypnotic states. My advice
is to be patient and to continue working with yourself.
It is not imperative or vital to reach the somnambulistic
stage for therapeutic results. It is a misconception
on the part of many students that they must go into the
deepest state possible to obtain results. Dramatic changes
can come about at all levels of hypnosis. The somnambulistic
state is necessary in hypnotherapy when there is a
need for the patient to relive some traumatic episode. It is
also useful when the patient is reluctant to consciously
discuss certain aspects of his problem. Many hypnotherapeutic
techniques such as amnesia, hypermnesia, progression,
paramnesia, automatic writing, dream induction,
regression, production of experimental conflicts and crystal
or mirror gazing require a somnambulistic state. For
those of you interested in hypnotherapy, I can recommend
no finer book than <i>Hypnotherapy of War Neuroses</i> by
John G. Watkins, Ph.D. In this book, the theory of hypnotherapy
has been diagramatically presented for easy comprehension
and shown to be an amalgamation of concepts
and practices from various schools of thought.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[<a href="./images/81.png">81</a>]</span></p>

<p>Most students of hypnosis equate the phenomenon of
amnesia with the somnambulistic state. The mistake they
make is in trying to achieve amnesia. It's similar to the
dog trying to catch his tail. It is impossible for the subject
to effectively suggest amnesia to himself. If he remembers
what he was supposed to forget, he has failed. If he truly
doesn't remember what he was supposed to forget, he
doesn't even remember the amnesia suggestion and can
take no satisfaction from his success because he is not
aware that he has accomplished the posthypnotic suggestion.
Unless an elaborate set of posthypnotic suggestions
are worked out, it is an impossible test for self-hypnosis.</p>

<p>I know the reader is anxious to begin his conditioning
for the somnambulistic state, but there are still a few
pertinent remarks which should be remembered before
proceeding further. The reader should not memorize verbatim
any of the tests involved in proving the somnambulistic
state. All that is necessary to remember is the general
form and the goal you seek. The goal is to increase your
suggestibility which, in turn, means deepening of the
hypnotic state. After each step, you are to give yourself
suggestions that you will go still deeper the next time.
You should also designate a specific length of time to
work with self-hypnosis. The suggestions are as follows:
"I shall work with self-hypnosis for 15 minutes. At the
end of that time, I shall open my eyes and wake up feeling
wonderfully well. I'll be wide awake and refreshed. In
case of any danger, I'll be able to awaken immediately
and act accordingly."</p>

<p>Some hypnotists tell their subjects to "make your mind
a blank." I suppose what they really mean is that you must
try to think of only what the hypnotist is saying. Have
you ever tried to make your mind a blank? Try it for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[<a href="./images/82.png">82</a>]</span>
moment. It's an impossibility. Should the hypnotist persist
along these lines, he'll never be successful. It is the wrong
approach. The subject, because of his inability to comply
with this suggestion, is fighting a losing battle. It is also
almost impossible for the subject to concentrate only
on what the hypnotist is saying. Any word the hypnotist
says can start a conscious as well as unconscious train of
thought. Therefore, in reality, this, too, is impossible.
However, it really isn't necessary that the subject keep
his thoughts concentrated solely on what is being said so
long as they are kept in the general area. At times, the
more you try to concentrate, the more your thoughts become
scattered. Suppose I say to you, "Forget the address
8721 Sunset Boulevard." What happens? The more you
try to forget it, the more you remember it. Therefore,
don't be concerned if you experience stray thoughts during
the induction and deepening of hypnosis. You are
now ready to continue with further tests. The first five tests
should be mastered before continuing.</p>

<p>Test No. 6 is referred to as the "fly" test. In this test,
once under hypnosis, you picture that a fly is crawling on
the back of your right or left hand. Once you feel the fly,
you know you are deeply hypnotized. You might even get
an urge to move your hand and flick the fly off your hand.
When this happens, you know, of course, that you are
deeply hypnotized. Here is a sample of the type of suggestions
to give:</p>

<p>"As I count to ten and even before I reach the count of
ten, I shall feel a fly crawling on the back of my right
hand. This illusion will seem very real to me. One ... My
right hand is completely relaxed. Two ... I feel completely
at ease. Three ... I am beginning to feel a pleasant
tingling feeling on the back of my right hand. Four ...
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[<a href="./images/83.png">83</a>]</span>
This feeling is becoming strong. Five ... It feels as though
a fly is moving on the back of my hand. Six ... I have had
this same feeling before. Seven ... I can feel the fly. Eight
... The feeling is very definite. Nine ... As I flick my hand
the fly will disappear (If you have felt the fly, move your
hand). Ten ... It is gone."</p>

<p>Test No. 7 is known as the "cigarette" test and naturally
is only for those of you who smoke. In this test, you give
yourself posthypnotic suggestions during the hypnotic
state, awaken yourself, and then note the effects of the
posthypnotic suggestions. If the cigarette tastes bitter or
has a repugnant taste or odor, and if you furthermore find
it impossible to smoke more than three puffs, necessitating
your putting out the cigarette, you know the posthypnotic
suggestions are working perfectly and that you are an excellent
hypnotic subject. Here are the suggestions to give
yourself while you are under hypnosis:</p>

<p>"When I count to three, I shall open my eyes and wake
up feeling wonderfully well and shall have a strong desire
to smoke a cigarette. Upon lighting the cigarette, I shall
notice that there is a very bitter, strong and repugnant
taste to the cigarette. As I continue to smoke the cigarette,
the distasteful effect will become stronger and stronger.
Even though I realize that I have given myself these posthypnotic
suggestions, they will exert a strong force outside
of my conscious control, and I shall find it necessary to
extinguish the cigarette after three puffs. As I now count
to three, I shall open my eyes and wake up feeling fine.
One, two, three."</p>

<p>Test No. 8 is called the "sun" test. In this test, you picture
yourself in a bathing suit, shorts or playsuit at the
beach or some other familiar place taking a sunbath. You
imagine that it is a beautiful summer day. As you see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[<a href="./images/84.png">84</a>]</span>
yourself relaxed, you imagine that a cloud is blocking out
the sun, but as you count to three, the cloud will move
away and you will feel the warm, pleasant glow of the
sun's rays on your face and hands. Here are the suggestions
you can use:</p>

<p>"As I count to three, I shall feel the warm, pleasant
rays of the sun on my face and hands. One ... The cloud
is moving, and I can begin to feel the warm, pleasant rays
of the sun. Two ... The cloud is moving more and more,
exposing more and more of the sun. I can feel the warmth
of the sun's rays. Three ... The cloud has moved away
from the sun, and I can feel the full, warm strength of
the sun. It is a pleasant feeling, but as I continue to count
to five, the warm feeling will dissipate. Four ... The warm
feeling is leaving. Five ... The warm feeling has left, and
I feel perfectly normal in every respect."</p>

<p>A variation of this test is to see yourself lying comfortably
in front of a fireplace. In this instance, you imagine
someone is adding wood to the fire. As this is done, you
feel the warm glow of the fire more and more. Should
you use the fireplace technique, try to incorporate the
sound of rain into the picture. If you "hear" rain you
have created a positive auditory hallucination and can
consider yourself an excellent subject.</p>

<p>You can also visualize a situation where you would be
cold. This is not as pleasant as the picture that one can
conjure up about a fireplace and thus creates a bit more
resistance since no one wants to feel uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Test No. 9 is the "breeze" test. It can be combined with
the previous test. After you attain the feeling of warmth,
you give yourself a count of three (or whatever number
you want), suggesting that you will feel the cool ocean
breeze (if you are at the beach) on your face and hands.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[<a href="./images/85.png">85</a>]</span>
You can even carry this step further, suggesting that you'll
even smell the odor of the salt water. This is known as an
olfactory illusion and should you be able to create this
effect, you can be sure that you are a somnambulistic subject.
Here are suggestions you can use:</p>

<p>"As I count to three, I shall gradually feel the cool
ocean breeze coming over the waves. It will be a very
pleasant feeling. One ... I am beginning to feel the cool
ocean breeze, especially on my face and hands. Two ...
The breeze is becoming stronger and stronger. Three ... I
can definitely feel the cool ocean breeze. As I continue to
count to five, I shall smell the pleasant, healthy aroma of
the salt water. Four ... I am beginning to smell the salt
water. Five ... I can definitely smell the salt water."</p>

<p>Now you give yourself appropriate suggestions that the
feeling (illusion) will vanish as you awaken or at a specific
count. It can be as simple as this: "As I count to three,
I shall open my eyes and awaken feeling very refreshed.
The feeling of the cool ocean breeze and smell of the salt
air will have vanished completely." At this point you
count to three and open your eyes.</p>

<p>Test No. 10 is the "handclasp" test. This is used frequently
to test the depth of hypnosis. You fold your hands
with your fingers tightly interlocked and place your palms
together. You then give yourself a hypnotic suggestion
that at the count of three, it will be impossible for you
to unlock your hands. After you try and are unable to
unlock your hands, you continue counting to five, suggesting
that you will be able to do so when you reach the count
of five. Incidentally, you should remove any ring you may
be wearing before trying this test. Here are the suggestions
you can follow:</p>

<p>"As I complete the count of three, I shall try to unlock
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[<a href="./images/86.png">86</a>]</span>
my hands but will be unable to do so until I count to five.
One ... My hands are locked tightly together. Two ... My
fingers are locked tighter and tighter. Three ... It is impossible
for me to unlock my hands until I count to five.
Four ... As I reach the count of five, I shall be able to
unlock my hands very easily. Five ... I can now unlock
my hands very easily."</p>

<p>Test No. 11 is the "arm" test. Here is another test used
frequently to test the receptiveness to hypnosis. Make a
tight fist and extend your arm in front of you as far as
possible. Visualize your arm as one solid mass, as stiff
and rigid as a bar of steel. After your arm is extended,
give yourself a hypnotic suggestion that you will be unable
to bend your arm when you complete the count of
three. As you continue to count to five, you will be able
to bend your arm very easily. Here is a form of suggestion
you can use:</p>

<p>"As I reach the count of three, I shall try to bend my
arm, but it will be impossible to do so until I count to
five. No matter how hard I try, it will be absolutely impossible.
One ... My arm is stiff and rigid as a bar of steel.
Two ... I can feel the rigidity in my arm. Three ... It is
impossible for me to bend my arm until I count to five.
Four ... I can feel the stiffness slowly leaving. Five ... I
can now bend my arm easily and it feels normal in every
respect."</p>

<p>Test No. 12 is the "eye" test. This is probably the most
widely used test in hypnosis. Many subjects equate the
inability to open the eyes with hypnosis. Many assume that
if they can open their eyes, they have not been hypnotized.
I must emphatically point out that this is not true. The
subject can fail the eye test and yet have been under
hypnosis. In the deep, somnambulistic state, the subject
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[<a href="./images/87.png">87</a>]</span>
can open his eyes without affecting the depth of the hypnotic
state. In fact, this is done many times in getting the
subject to do automatic writing, crystal gazing, mirror
gazing, hypnodrama and revivification. In carrying out
posthypnotic suggestions in any state, the subject is frequently
told that he will open his eyes and carry out the
suggestion.</p>

<p>I have found that there is more anxiety connected with
the eye test than with any other test. I feel that it is a
normal reaction and one that must be anticipated by the
hypnotist as well as the subject. Occasionally, while hypnotizing
a new subject, he will open his eyes. This can
happen when the subject feels he is losing consciousness.
His ability to open his eyes proves to him that he is in
control. One of the main fears that the subject has is his
belief that he will lose voluntary control of himself. The
fact that he can open his eyes lessens his anxiety.</p>

<p>If there seems to be too much threat to the individual,
I use a method that you can follow. Instead of suggesting
that the subject will be unable to open his eyes at a
specific count, I suggest that he will be so relaxed that it
will be too much effort to open his eyes until a further
count is given. Actually, what could take less effort? Here
are suggestions you can use:</p>

<p>"As I count to three, I shall try to open my eyes, but I
shall be unable to do so because I feel so relaxed. It will
just take too much effort to open my eyes until I reach the
count of five or tell myself to awaken. One ... My eyes are
closed, and I am in a very deep state of hypnosis. Two ...
My eyelids are stuck tightly together. Three ... It is now
impossible for me to open my eyes. I shall be able to open
them though at the count of five. Four ... I shall be able
to open my eyes very easily at the count of five. Five ... I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[<a href="./images/88.png">88</a>]</span>
can now open my eyes and wake up feeling alert and fully
refreshed."</p>

<p>In accomplishing the eye test, you try to create a vivid
picture of yourself being completely and fully relaxed.
If you really exerted a great deal of effort, you could open
your eyes, but because of the pleasantness of the completely
relaxed state, you prefer not to do so. It can be
likened to your enduring the cold winter air when you
are half asleep in bed instead of getting up to close the
window which has been left open too much. You can,
of course, get up and close the window, but it becomes a
matter of expending too much energy. Instead, you choose
to endure the discomfort or suggest that your spouse close
the window.</p>

<p>For the following three tests, you give yourself the suggestions
as outlined in the previous tests. It should be
pointed out again that at the conclusion of the test, you
give yourself a suggestion that you will feel normal in
every respect.</p>

<p>Test No. 13 is the "music" test. This test involves creating
an auditory hallucination. Give yourself the suggestion
that at a specific count you will hear your favorite
song. It will last for one minute and then fade out.</p>

<p>Test No. 14 is the "dream" test. It is incorporated in a
great deal of hypnotherapy. The subject is told that as
the hypnotist counts to three, the subject will have a dream
lasting for several minutes which he will remember. This
dream, furthermore, will call his attention to an important
incident that he has long forgotten, yet which will be
relevant to his problem. In self-hypnosis, you suggest to
yourself that at a specific count you will have a very pleasant
dream lasting for several minutes, at the end of which
time you will awaken feeling refreshed. For those readers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[<a href="./images/89.png">89</a>]</span>
further interested in producing dreams, I can highly recommend
a very fascinating book called <i>The Experimental
Production of Dreams During Hypnosis</i> by Professor
David Ballin Klein.</p>

<p>Test No. 15 is the "anesthesia" test. This is conducted
by telling yourself that you will not feel the pain associated
with the act of pinching yourself. You suggest that
you will feel the pressure of your fingers but will not feel
the pain involved. <i>I urge the reader not to stick pins in
himself to test the anesthesia. This can be dangerous, lead
to infection and cause other harmful results.</i> You should
also not dig your nails into your skin to make sure that you
don't feel pain.</p>

<h3>A New Approach to Self-Hypnosis
When All Else Fails</h3>


<p>Let us assume that you have tried diligently to learn
self-hypnosis for a month or more but have failed. You
have worked faithfully following the instructions outlined
in this book and other books on self-hypnosis, but somehow
the state of hypnosis eludes you. Should you give up
in despair, or is there still hope for you? Let me assure
you that you can still become an excellent subject. Let us
examine several areas of this problem and a new approach
that will help you achieve your ends.</p>

<p>You must, first of all, ask yourself if you are feeling
better and whether you have made strides in the direction
you desire while giving yourself suggestions in whatever
stage of hypnosis you have achieved. If your evaluation
is affirmative to any degree, you can expect even greater
results. "But," you may say, "how can I expect greater
results when I haven't achieved self-hypnosis?" My answer
is you may be achieving self-hypnosis and not know
it! The change to the self-hypnotic state from the waking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[<a href="./images/92.png">92</a>]</span>
state can be imperceptible. Many times, prior to testing
subjects under hypnosis, I ask them if they think they are
in the hypnotic state. The answer is invariably no. When
asking the subjects for a cogent reason for this answer,
they usually exclaim that they are aware of what is going
on and do not feel any different than they did before I
started working with them. They are amazed to find that
various tests work so perfectly.</p>

<p>Some subjects do not respond to hypnotic tests no
matter how long you work with them. For these persons,
I usually de-emphasize the need for passing the tests and
concentrate on the therapeutic results which are desired.
This approach lessens anxiety and usually results in a
deepening of the hypnotic state. It is my feeling that many
subjects resist any tests as the implication is that once the
tests work, the subject is under complete control of the
hypnotist. The subject may fear this supposed subjection on
one hand and yet want it on the other hand. These forces
can work unconsciously, and thus the attainment of
hypnosis becomes a very intricate, perplexing and trying
procedure. Even though this may be so, I can assure you
that the problem and attainment of hypnosis can be resolved.
It is only a matter of motivation on the part of the
subject. This is the main ingredient necessary for successful
hypnosis.</p>

<p>Let me now explain a technique which has worked
admirably for many who have been frustrated because of
their inability to achieve self-hypnosis. It involves <i>pretending
you are hypnotized</i> and going through the motions
of the various tests <i>as though you were a perfect subject</i>.
You will recall that one theory of hypnosis is that the subject
behaves in a manner that he believes is in keeping
with hypnotic behavior. This role playing is the basis for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[<a href="./images/93.png">93</a>]</span>
our unique approach. As the subject continues this procedure,
he takes on the conditioned response mechanism
necessary for self-hypnosis. Let us look at the following
examples of role playing.</p>

<p>During the war, many soldiers who wanted to leave the
army would pretend something was wrong with them.
They would convince the authorities of the authenticity
of their "illness," and since nothing seemed to make them
better, they eventually were separated from the service because
of the incapacitating disorder. But what happened
to many of these malingerers after they were released from
the service? I'm sure you know the rest of the story. The
constant malingering was transformed by this role playing
into a conditioned response pattern, eventually bringing
about the very undesirable condition responsible for their
leaving the service. I saw some of these individuals and
more than once they told me that they had unwittingly
hypnotized themselves into having the ailment. They
wanted me to dehypnotize them. They actually turned out
to be very easy subjects as they had become highly suggestible.
Unfortunately, their super-ego structure was
weak, they had difficulty in identifying strongly with anyone,
and the relationship in hypnosis was superficial and
without depth.</p>

<p>I am going to relate another example which I hope will
help you understand the role-playing technique for self-hypnosis.
I have had the following experience many times
in giving hypnotic demonstrations before various organizations.
For some reason, even though I carefully ask that
only those who desire to be hypnotized volunteer as subjects
for the hypnotic demonstrations, an individual who
has no intention of cooperating comes up on the stage to
poke fun at the hypnotist. In giving public demonstrations,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[<a href="./images/94.png">94</a>]</span>
I usually work with about ten subjects and simultaneously
give them the same suggestions and posthypnotic
suggestions. Once the subjects are hypnotized, I work with
them with their eyes open. Using this technique, with each
subject carrying out a posthypnotic suggestion, intensifies
the responses of other subjects. There is also competitiveness
to become the best subject.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the individual who is really not under
hypnosis has let the audience know about it by winking
or making a grimace when I was not looking at him. Observing
laughter and other audience reactions which are
not in keeping with what is happening at the precise moment
during my lecture is my cue that I have an egocentric
person on stage. You might ask, "Can't you tell when
someone is faking?" It is extremely difficult many times
to do so. Once you are aware of it, however, you give
certain tests to the group. The exhibitionist doesn't know
how to respond each time and you soon pick him out.</p>

<p>Even when I know specifically who it is, I do not dismiss
him. Interestingly, it is invariably a man. I continue
with the lecture-demonstration; but I let the audience
know that I am aware of the situation. This is the interesting
part of this example. The bumptious subject, by giving
himself autosuggestions to comply with various posthypnotic
suggestions, is actually engaging in our technique of
role playing. The inevitable happens. He finds himself
hypnotized despite his obvious intention not to be affected
in any way. Any hypnotist can recount similar incidents.</p>

<p>What can you learn by the example just presented?
What if you purposely set about doing the same thing in
your attempt to achieve self-hypnosis? The obvious answer
is that the technique has a good chance of working,
and as a result you will achieve self-hypnosis. This method
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[<a href="./images/95.png">95</a>]</span>
has worked with many recalcitrant subjects. To follow
this plan, go back to <a href="#chapter6">chapter six</a>, "How To Attain Self-Hypnosis,"
and use the role-playing technique. You'll be
pleasantly surprised at how this approach will act as a
catalyst. Remember, once you obtain the eye closure, give
yourself whatever therapeutic suggestion you desire plus
the posthypnotic suggestion that the next time you will
fall into a deeper and sounder state of hypnosis at the
count of three or any other cue you desire.</p>

<p>I know you may protest using the role-playing technique
with the question, "If I'm not under hypnosis, why
give myself therapeutic posthypnotic suggestions to condition
myself to go under hypnosis at a specific count?"
You may further protest that you are only fooling yourself.
My answer is, "What if you are?" What is lost by doing it?
You have everything to gain and nothing to lose. Are you
not really interested in the end result and not the means?
The attainment of the self-hypnotic state is not in itself the
end result; it is a means to help you achieve your goal.</p>

<p>Don't many people carry or wear good-luck charms of
a religious or nonreligious nature? Don't we accept these
items in our society? The four-leaf clover and rabbit's foot
as symbols of good luck have been part of our culture for
a long time. We are all sophisticated enough to know that
they do not have an intrinsic value, but don't they do
something for our mental attitude? This same pattern is
precisely what you are to follow in using the role-playing
technique. If you believe, expect and imagine that you will
be successful in this approach to self-hypnosis, I can assure
you that you will.</p>

<p>May I urge you not to reject this novel and unorthodox
approach. Many have had excellent results when other
methods, even those of a professional hypnotist, have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[<a href="./images/96.png">96</a>]</span>
failed. Some of you may recognize this approach as another
means of applying the visual-imagery technique.
Whatever you choose to call it, I reiterate you can expect
good results. It is only necessary that you follow the instructions
and adopt the right attitude. By the right attitude,
I mean that you should adopt the conviction that
you are going to achieve self-hypnosis even though you
might have experienced difficulty up to now. Hypnosis
is a conviction phenomenon.</p>

<p>It is possible you may say you are not suggestible.
Actually, your lack of response proves your suggestibility.
You have been influenced by negative suggestions. Everyone
is suggestible to some degree. You have become extremely
suggestible to conscious or unconscious stimuli
which are definitely affecting your ability to respond. You
need only use this latent suggestibility and make it work
for you. What would you say about the suggestibility of
a person who doesn't want to talk about hypnosis? This
person has never read a book on hypnosis and absolutely
doesn't want you or anyone else to hypnotize him. Would
you believe this person is a potentially good hypnotic
subject? I can tell you by practical experience that once
this person allows himself to be hypnotized, he turns out
to be a perfect subject. Responding to either end of the
suggestibility scale is indicative of success with hypnosis.
It becomes a matter of manipulating this suggestibility
skillfully in order to achieve results.</p>

<p>Let me give you another example which may help.
Which one of the two lines drawn on this page is longer?
Line AB or line CD?</p>

<div class="centre">
<img src="images/lines1.png"
alt="Two lines, AB and CD. AB has an outward pointing arrow
on each side, while CD has them pointing the opposite way.
A &lt;----&gt; B
C &gt;----&lt; D"
title="Two lines, AB and CD. AB has an outward pointing arrow
on each side, while CD has them pointing the opposite way.
A &lt;----&gt; B
C &gt;----&lt; D" />
</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[<a href="./images/97.png">97</a>]</span></p>

<p>What is your answer? Did you think both were the same?
Take a ruler and actually measure them. You'll find line
AB longer than CD. "But," you reply, "every other time
both lines were the same." This is a familiar optical
illusion which is used many times in basic courses in psychology.
It is known as the Muller-Lyer illusion. My contention
is that if you said, "Both are the same size," you
are potentially a good subject. You respond perfectly to
previous conditioning; thus, you are responding as anticipated.
If, on the other hand, you picked line AB, you are
normally suggestible. If you honestly picked line CD, you
are extremely cautious and respond best to "reverse psychology."
Once again you are highly suggestible, but
toward one extreme.</p>

<div class="centre">
<img src="images/lines2.png"
alt="Radiating straight lines bisecting
two parallel horizons, AB and CD."
title="Radiating straight lines bisecting
two parallel horizons, AB and CD." />

<img src="images/lines3.png"
alt="Converging straight lines bisecting
two parallel horizons, AB and CD."
title="Converging straight lines bisecting
two parallel horizons, AB and CD." />
</div>


<p>Here's another interesting experiment. Would you say
that lines AB and CD were perfectly straight? I'll let you
figure out what your response means to this test by yourself.
You can take a ruler to determine if the lines are
straight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[<a href="./images/98.png">98</a>]</span></p>

<p>We all respond unconsciously to stimuli of some sort.
Word association tests are based on this principle. Aren't
your reactions automatic to the following terms: democratic
party, republican party, communist party, mother,
father, movie star? If I mention the name of a famous person,
city or country, the same immediate unconscious reaction
takes place. Let's try it. Theodore Roosevelt, Harry
Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Albert
Einstein, Albert Schweitzer, Eleanor Roosevelt, Boston,
New York City, Hollywood, Miami Beach, United
States, England, France, Italy, Israel, Africa, Russia, China,
India and South America. The response and image keep
changing, don't they?</p>

<p>I am trying to point out that this reaction is automatic
because of previous conditioning. I could mention almost
anything and the same automatic reaction would take
place. The reaction would always be the same unless something
had happened to change or alter your response. Let
us mention the word hypnosis. Some sort of reaction must
take place. This can either be positive, negative, or neutral
for our purposes. You really don't have to think about
your response as it is automatic. The point to remember is
that a definite response has taken place which will either
help or hinder your attainment of hypnosis. If the response
should be negative, it can be changed by gaining knowledge
and actual experience in hypnosis. It is natural to
have a bit of uneasiness when first experiencing or thinking
about being hypnotized. After all, you haven't been
exposed to hypnosis in a therapeutic setting and couldn't
have formed a favorable reaction. Your response is probably
derived from a fictionization of hypnosis. The initial
task of the hypnotist is to create, by educating the prospective
subject, a favorable attitude so that the subject
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[<a href="./images/99.png">99</a>]</span>
allows himself to be hypnotized.</p>

<p>What does this mean specifically to you if you are having
difficulty learning self-hypnosis? It means that through
repeated exposures, you will finally respond. You will
realize there is no need for anxiety in regard to your response.
This inner feeling will, in turn, have a cumulative,
favorable effect upon your unconscious which will result
in your finally responding to hypnosis.</p>

<p>Suppose you still maintain and insist that you are not
suggestible and wonder if you will ever respond to hypnosis.
Furthermore, the assurance I have given you up to this
point doesn't seem to convince you. If you have tried diligently
to achieve self-hypnosis, you cannot be blamed, but
let's try an experiment to test your suggestibility. It is well
to ponder my statement that if you do not respond, it is a
sign of being suggestible, but in a negative sense. Lack of
response is a manifestation of this negative suggestibility.
My contention is that you are definitely suggestible. Let us
see what happens to you in trying the following classical
experiment. It is called the Chevreul's Pendulum test.</p>

<p>Draw a circle with about a six-inch diameter and mark
it as shown in the illustration.</p>

<div class="centre">
<img src="images/circle.png"
alt="The circle is divided into quarters, and marked
with the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4."
title="The circle is divided into quarters, and marked
with the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4." />
</div>


<p>Next, take a ring and attach a string to it. If you have
a locket, it will do as well. The hypnotist uses a crystal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[<a href="./images/100.png">100</a>]</span>
ball and chain for this experiment. Hold the end of the
string or chain and keep the ring or whatever object you
are using about three inches above the center of the circle.</p>

<p>Now, concentrate and fix your gaze on the ring, crystal
ball, or locket. Mentally suggest to yourself that the object
will begin to revolve in a circular manner following
the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. Picture in your mind's eye
that this circular motion is becoming wider and wider.
Work at this image for several minutes. Did the object
begin turning to the right following the numbers? Did the
circle become larger and larger? If it did, you are absolutely
suggestible, are influenced by your own suggestions
and, therefore, if you follow instructions, can learn self-hypnosis.
You can be trained to acquire this skill.</p>

<p>If the experience did not work, try it again. Concentrate
harder and try to visualize more intently the object revolving
in a circular manner. You are not to rotate the
object consciously or help it in any way. The action must
stem from your subconscious. The thought of the crystal
ball or ring revolving in a clockwise or counterclockwise
direction invariably causes an involuntary muscular reflex
action to take place. This phenomenon is known as an
ideomotor action. Usually, as the subject concentrates
more intensely, the reflex action becomes more profound,
causing greater unconscious movement of the hand which,
in turn, is transmitted to the object in the form of larger
circles and greater momentum. The time required for the
successful accomplishment of this test depends upon the
degree of suggestibility of the subject. An interesting action
is to see the object revolve in an opposite direction
than suggested. It gives a clue to the personality structure
of the individual.</p>

<p>The Ouija board works on the same principle as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[<a href="./images/101.png">101</a>]</span>
Chevreul's Pendulum test. Many times the aspirant will
remark, "I swear I didn't make it move!" Mentalists find
hidden objects in an audience using basically the same
approach, combined with clever techniques of distraction.
The term given for this is "muscle reading."</p>

<p>This is the point in question. If the crystal ball, ring or
locket moves without conscious direction, you have successfully
influenced your subconscious mind. Self-hypnosis
involves the same procedure. The goal is to consciously
cause a subconscious reaction. If the experiment does not
work with your eyes open, try it with your eyes closed for
about five minutes. You will be pleasantly surprised with
the results. Should you want to prove to yourself that you
are suggestible with your eyes open, practice the technique
every day for a week or two. The idea of the practice
sessions is to reinforce and increase the response of the
unconscious movement until you develop proficiency. It
follows the laws of the conditioned reflex theory expounded
by Dr. Ivan P. Pavlov (1849-1936), the famous
Russian psychologist. If, after several weeks, you should
still not be successful, use the role-playing technique. Consciously
make the object revolve. After a while, it will
move automatically whenever you attempt the experiment.</p>

<p>When this happens you will have proof of your suggestibility.
It is highly improbable that you will not be successful.
It would be a rare occurrence. By the same systematic
efforts, I can assure you that you can achieve self-hypnosis.
If you are still not affected favorably, you might consider
one of the psychological means of inducing hypnosis. The
next chapter will discuss this topic.</p>

<p>I would recommend Pavlov's book called <i>Conditioned
Reflexes</i>. Pavlov's book will further explain and clarify
the concept of the conditioned response mechanism. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[<a href="./images/102.png">102</a>]</span>
covers necessary conditions for the development of conditioned
responses, their formation by means of conditioned
and direct stimuli, plus a tremendous amount of
material which will help you in your understanding of the
significance of the role-playing technique in relationship
to learning self-hypnosis.</p>

<h2><a name="chapter11" id="chapter11"></a><i>Chapter 11</i></h2>

<h3>Psychological Aids and Their Function</h3>


<p>Psychological or mechanical aids are used to help put
the subject in a state of hypnosis. The use of the aids helps
increase the suggestibility of the subject toward hypnosis.
The two most widely used hypnotic aids are the crystal
ball and chain and the 12-inch hypnodisc. One reason is
that these two items have no other use or function outside
of the area of hypnosis. Therefore, when the hypnotist
proceeds to use one of these hypnotic devices, it must follow
that a certain mental set, readiness, or receptivity must
follow as a result of its introduction into the hypnotic setting.
If the subject is uneasy about the hypnotic setting
or his response, the introduction of the hypnotic aid can
mobilize the subject's defenses which may be on a conscious
or unconscious level. Generally, the mental set
which follows helps augment whatever hypnotic suggestions
are given. Certainly the same mental set would not
follow if the hypnotist used a paper clip as a means of
helping with the induction of hypnosis. It would only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[<a href="./images/104.png">104</a>]</span>
start the subject wondering about the relationship of the
paper clip to hypnosis. It obviously isn't in keeping with
what the subject expects.</p>

<p>It is important to utilize the subject's expectation as to
what he believes takes place in the setting as long as this
expectation does not hinder the induction of hypnosis.
The mere act of turning down the lights or drawing the
curtains before the hypnotist begins to work with the subject
is a non-verbal suggestion which can be considered
as a psychological aid. The subject knows that the hypnotist
is ready to begin at this point. Actually, it isn't necessary
to darken the room at any time to induce hypnosis.
Doesn't the stage hypnotist work with glaring lights? The
room is darkened (and I might add that I use this procedure
myself) mainly for the psychological effect. If I
feel that this procedure might cause anxiety, I proceed
with the room undarkened.</p>

<p>In discussing psychological aids, it is agreed that we
are primarily interested in seeing the subject feel better
or achieve whatever goals he seeks through the intelligent
application of self-hypnosis. If a hypnotic aid will help
the subject achieve hypnosis, we can concur it is justified.
It is not to be considered a subterfuge. If the physician
administers a placebo to a patient with the remark, "Here
is a new medication that can help your condition" and if
this technique does help alleviate the patient's condition,
it is considered good medicine.</p>

<p>You know beforehand that in using the 12-inch hypnodisc,
the subject's eyes must begin to water, his eyelids
must get heavy, and eventually he must close them. Even
before you begin to use the hypnodisc, you suggest that
these conditions will take place. During the induction of
hypnosis, as these reactions are noted by the subject, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[<a href="./images/105.png">105</a>]</span>
favorable, psychological attitude automatically develops
which, in turn, helps further suggestions. If the subject
reacts favorably to suggestions A, B, and C, it follows that
he is more prone to accept suggestions D, E, and F which
are therapeutic in nature. The subject can relate better to
the latter suggestions when he has seen proof of his initial
suggestibility. This approach works better than beginning
immediately with the latter suggestions. The build-up of
suggestions convinces the subject he is in a heightened
state of suggestibility and can benefit from the therapeutic
suggestions of the hypnotist or his own. Perhaps this
needed assurance is so helpful because it eliminates the
anxiety of the subject concerning his suggestibility. He
seeks and needs the satisfaction of knowing he has attained
the prerequisites necessary before any therapeutic
program can benefit him. The subject's prerequisites need
not be actually related to the hypnotic process, per se, but
merely match his preconceived ideas about what is necessary.
Let me give you an example.</p>

<p>Many subjects feel that they must experience amnesia
before they can benefit from hypnotic suggestions. This
premise is inaccurate since favorable and lasting results
can be achieved in any degree of hypnosis, depending, of
course, on the nature of the problem. Let me relate several
interesting occurrences that take place every so often in
my own practice as a professional hypnotist. A subject
who is responding well to hypnosis, but not to the point
of amnesia, insists that he will not benefit until he is
"knocked out" and doesn't remember what happened.
Trying to convince him otherwise proves fatal. He just
refuses to accept whatever explanation you give him. My
own method is not to insist that the subject is wrong, but
somehow to use his misconception in a constructive manner.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[<a href="./images/106.png">106</a>]</span>
After getting him into a cataleptic state, I suggest that
I am going to stop talking for five minutes, during which
time he is to mentally repeat "sleep" as he slowly and
deeply inhales and "deep sleep" as he slowly exhales. At
the end of this time, he'll be in a very deep hypnotic state.
Instead of remaining quiet for five minutes, I take ten
minutes. I then begin to whisper suggestions to the subject
to determine if he is still under hypnosis or asleep. If he is
asleep, I let him remain asleep for a still longer period of
time, after which interval I awaken him. I ask him if he
remembers what I said to him during the time he was
deeply hypnotized. If he says, "No," I remark, "Very
good." I further point out to him that he has now experienced
amnesia and will now make rapid strides. The subject,
on the other hand, is pleased to see that I now agree
with him, and, in fact, the interesting result is that he does
make excellent progress because his preconceived requirements
have been met. It should be pointed out that I keep
working with the subject until such time that he falls
asleep. The transition from hypnosis to sleep is normal.
It is easy for the subject to fall asleep because he is so
relaxed.</p>

<p>Let me tell you of a similar experience. Before telling
you of this psychological technique, it is only fair to point
out that the professional hypnotist varies his approach
from subject to subject, not only to suit the needs of the
subject but to break the monotony of using only a few
successful procedures. His experimentation helps develop
not only new procedures, but new concepts relative to the
general nature of hypnosis and its many ramifications. I
was interested to see what would happen to a subject if
he thought he was deeply hypnotized without ever giving
him verbal suggestions or reassurance that he would feel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[<a href="./images/107.png">107</a>]</span>
better or overcome his problem. Of course, if the technique
did not work quickly, I would drop the procedure
for a more orthodox approach. Instead of trying to really
hypnotize the subject, my aim is to get him to sleep. Once
he is asleep, I let him remain so for about 30 minutes.
Without having ever given him a therapeutic suggestion,
I awaken him and inquire if he remembered what happened.
If the answer is, "No," I tell him I'll "hypnotize"
him again next week and this concludes the visit. When
he returns next week, I ask him, "How did you feel during
the week?" The answer is generally, "Much better." I
keep repeating this procedure until such time that the
individual has attained the goals that he seeks.</p>

<p>I know that the reader may be surprised that I would
divulge such an unconventional procedure. The principle
is the same as the physician using a placebo. I do so to
illustrate the point that I made earlier in this chapter that
so long as certain of the subject's requirements are met,
whether valid or invalid, the subject's suggestibility is
greatly enhanced. Naturally, the unsuspecting subject
equated the period of not remembering, which was, as
we know, true sleep, with the somnambulistic state. Actually,
he was helped by self-hypnosis because he felt he
would now make progress because he proved to be such
an excellent subject. It is true, he was not using self-hypnosis
as has been outlined in this book, but he had now
achieved a heightened state of suggestibility (hypnosis)
and was using this state to further his own ends.</p>

<p>The attainment of self-hypnosis can be an intricate and
elusive procedure as I have already pointed out. The purpose
of the entire book is to instruct, point out and give
you the necessary understanding and knowledge required
to achieve this end. Without this understanding, this can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[<a href="./images/108.png">108</a>]</span>
become a very frustrating effort. It is hoped that by understanding
and being aware of some of the ramifications of
hypnosis, you will be able to achieve your goal in the
quickest possible time. It should also be pointed out that
no two subjects react in the same way and that different
methods and requirements are necessary to suit the individual.
It is a mistake to try to make the subject adhere to
a rigid methodology. The greater flexibility of the hypnotic
procedures, the greater the chance for success. Let
me, at this time, further discuss some of the hypnotic aids
that are used in the induction of hypnosis.</p>

<p>We have already discussed the use of the hypnodisc and
crystal ball and chain. The same principles are involved
in any other object which is used as a means of fixation or
of tiring the eyes. Hypnotic phonograph records and hypnotic
tape recordings represent new devices that have been
instrumental in conditioning subjects for self-hypnosis.
The subject plays the record or tape on his phonograph
or tape recorder and is conditioned over a period of time
to respond to hypnosis at a given signal or phrase. He, in
turn, can change this key phrase to one of his own choosing.
Should you own or have access to a tape recorder, I
would suggest recording an induction of hypnosis and
playing it back to yourself in this manner as though you
were hypnotizing someone else.</p>

<p>I have produced three different hypnotic records and a
30-minute hypnotic tape containing the three records
which are sold commercially. One record, called the
Musical Hypnotic Record, has a very pleasant, relaxing
musical background as the voice of the hypnotist induces
hypnosis. The second record, called the Metronome Hypnotic
Record, incorporates the monotonous and lulling
beat of an electric metronome in the background. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[<a href="./images/109.png">109</a>]</span>
subject is instructed to mentally repeat "sleep" as he
slowly inhales and "deep sleep" as he slowly exhales in
rhythm with the beat of the metronome. While the subject
is concentrating on this activity, the voice of the hypnotist
induces hypnosis. The third record, called Self-Hypnosis
Record No. 3, contains only the voice of the hypnotist
inducing hypnosis. It features a unique approach and
technique.</p>

<p>I have had a great deal of correspondence with those
who have used these phonograph records and the hypnotic
tape for conditioning themselves for self-hypnosis. The
results are quite interesting and run the range of immediate
results to no results. One person wrote that one of the
records hypnotized him at the first playing and conditioned
him for self-hypnosis, whereas he had failed to
respond to hypnosis after many visits to one of the country's
foremost authorities. I have had similar experiences
after having failed to hypnotize a subject despite many
attempts. I can only speculate that the subjects in these
cases unconsciously resist the hypnotist because they feel
a personal threat. Since the record is impersonal, they are
better able to relax and subsequently be hypnotized. Interestingly,
this occurred when the subject was convinced
that he was a very difficult subject. It would seem that
only then was the conditioned response pattern finally
established. The basic function of the hypnotic records
and hypnotic tape is to establish a conditioned response
pattern to a given stimulus. In time, most subjects are
conditioned by the intelligent and systematic use of these
recordings.</p>

<p>Let me describe another varied approach to achieving
self-hypnosis. One of the chief assets of a good hypnotist
is to be flexible in his approach in hypnotizing his subjects.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[<a href="./images/110.png">110</a>]</span>
As I have already pointed out, it is necessary many
times to adopt a technique that is suitable to the subject
and not to make the subject adapt himself to the method
of induction.</p>

<p>We know that with somnambulistic subjects any procedure
will put the subject under hypnosis immediately.
The hypnotist gains complete control of his subject as the
subject is able to put himself in the proper psychological
frame of mind for hypnosis. Unfortunately, most subjects
do not respond at the first session or sessions because of
conscious or subconscious fears that must be gradually
eliminated. Once you get the subject to relax, or "let go,"
he will naturally succumb to hypnosis. This is the problem
that confronts all hypnotists.</p>

<p>Merely suggesting to the subject to relax is not sufficient,
as a rule, to bring about this desired mental state.
The subject, at this point, cannot easily turn on or off his
mental and physical feelings. Even if we have the subject
lie down, this does not assure the hypnotic state as the
subject can still be tense. Our main problem is to get the
subject relaxed. Our situation is similar to the physician
telling his patient to go home and forget about a certain
problem. I'm sure you'll agree that the advice is virtually
impossible to follow.</p>

<p>One of the major stumbling blocks in hypnotizing a
subject or in self-hypnosis lies in the fact that although we
use terms such as "relax," "let yourself go," and others,
the subject cannot readily put the meaning of these words
into effect. It is difficult for most people to let go when we
live in a society that beckons us to "look sharp," "be
sharp," "be alert," "be on the ball" and "make every minute
count." Emphasis on productivity does not lend to a
society of relaxed individuals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[<a href="./images/111.png">111</a>]</span></p>

<p>In my long experience as a professional hypnotist, I
have tried many novel innovations for inducing hypnosis
and teaching individuals self-hypnosis. Some have met
with a great deal of success and others have failed. It is,
furthermore, difficult to determine the causal factors for
success or failure. We can only theorize.</p>

<p>I have used the following unorthodox technique for
about a period of 15 years. Exceptionally good results
have been attained with it, although it must be admitted
that it is not infallible. It is suggested to you as another
good technique. In order to help the subject relax, I have
been using a phonograph record or tape that I recorded
containing the continuous sound of various degrees of
rain. One side has a half hour of very soft, light rainfall
such as you have experienced in listening to rain falling
on grass, canvas or a tent top. The other side or track contains
a half hour of rain effects such as one would hear in
a heavy downfall with loud splatterings of water on the
pavement. The record and tape were originally designed
to help insomnia sufferers and later incorporated into the
hypnotic procedure.</p>

<p>The subject is instructed to close his eyes and listen to
the sound of the rain while picturing himself relaxing
near a warm, glowing fireplace. As you can note, the subject
again incorporates the visual-imagery technique. The
relaxing effect thus produced over a period of time enhances
his chances of success in attaining a deep, hypnotic
state.</p>

<p>There are many other interesting and unique devices
and aids you can use for inducing hypnosis. Rather than
present them all in this book, I have fully described them
and their technique of operation in a 144-page illustrated
catalog. This catalog not only contains a list of hypnotic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[<a href="./images/112.png">112</a>]</span>
aids, but a description and listing of over 450 hypnotism
and self-help books. Upon request, I shall be pleased to
send it to you. Write to: Melvin Powers, 12015 Sherman
Road, No. Hollywood, California 91605 and ask for Hypnotic
Catalog No. 7. Should you have any questions on
self-hypnosis or hetero-hypnosis, I shall be pleased to
answer you.</p>

<h3>The Nature of Hypnosis</h3>


<p>Although the nature and phenomena of hypnosis are
still incompletely understood, there are a multitude of
theories which attempt to explain its mechanism and results.
The most that can be done at this time is to explore
various views which are held by leading authorities at
present. It can be said, however, that a majority of authorities
agree that hypnosis ensues as a result of natural laws
which have been incorporated in the human organism
since the beginning of man as he is today.</p>

<p>The older theories show almost as much disparity as today,
but for the purposes of history it is probably necessary
to enumerate only the "animal magnetism" of Frederick
Anton Mesmer, and a mention of the "hysteria syndrome"
of Jean Martin Charcot. Both names loom large in the
history of hypnosis. Mesmer, an 18th century physician,
believed that hypnosis occurred as a result of "vital fluids"
drawn from a magnet or lodestone and which drew their
unique qualities from the sun, moon and stars. Charcot,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[<a href="./images/114.png">114</a>]</span>
as well as Pierre Janet and others, was convinced that
hypnosis was a form of hysteria and that only hysterics
could be hypnotized. The former (Mesmer) thought further
that metal became imbued by the solar qualities, and
his system is also known as metalogy by which he meant
the proper application of metals. Naturally, these theories
have been largely abandoned today, although there are
still a few who think that hypnosis is a form of hysteria.</p>

<p>Some pioneers, notably Dr. William S. Kroger, a psychiatrically-oriented
obstetrician and gynecologist who
limits his practice to hypnotherapy, believe hypnosis is
a conviction phenomenon which produces results that
parallel the phenomena produced at Lourdes and other
religious healing shrines. His formula is that faith, hope,
belief and expectation, all catalyzed by the imagination,
lead inevitably to hypnosis. He, like Emile Cou&eacute; before
him, is convinced that you cannot "will" yourself to be
hypnotized, and that whenever the will and the imagination
come into conflict, the imagination wins out. This fits
in perfectly, of course, with the author's already discussed
visual-imagery technique which requires a high degree of
imagination. Dr. Kroger, like a few others, has proved to
his own satisfaction that all hypnotic phenomena can be
produced at a non-hypnotic level.</p>

<p>A large number of hypnotists, including the author, has
come to believe that hypnosis is a semantic problem in
which words are the building blocks to success. Not just
any words, but words which "ring a bell" or tap the experiential
background of the subject. This is why "sleep"
continues to be in the lexicon of the hypnotist even though
hypnosis is the antithesis of sleep. The word is used because
hypnosis superficially resembles sleep inasmuch as
the eyes usually are closed, the body in a posture of complete
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[<a href="./images/115.png">115</a>]</span>
relaxation. Actually, the mind is hyperacute. Pavlov,
however, believed that there was an analogy between
sleep and hypnosis in that each involved cerebral inhibition.
Words, of course, would be of little use without the
added effect of his conditioned reflexology.</p>

<p>Probably the most widely held theory is that hypnosis
is a transference phenomenon in which the prestige of the
hypnotist and his relationship to the subject plays an important
role. This theory is bolstered by the fact that all
schools of psychotherapy yield approximately the same
results even though the methods differ. This would logically
indicate that the relationship between the therapist
and the subject was the determining factor. The only
trouble with this theory is that it does not explain self-hypnosis.
On the other hand, we know that a strong interpersonal
relationship is necessary for hypnosis.</p>

<p>In <a href="#chapter1">the opening chapter of the book</a>, I explained that
hypnosis was a state of heightened suggestion in which
the subject adopted an uncritical attitude, allowing him
to accept suggestions and to take appropriate action. This
is excellent as far as it goes, but it does not explain how
suggestion works. This is the crux of the hypnotic dilemma
and the answer is far from solved. Hypnotists are
much like those who use electricity every day of their
lives, but have no idea of the nature of electricity. It is
enough for them to know it has been harnessed for their
use.</p>

<p>If there is one thing virtually certain about hypnosis
it is that some parts of the brain are inhibited and other
parts expanded by the process. Pin-point concentration
is given as the reason for this selective procedure which
narrows the horizon of the subject to what the hypnotist
(or he, himself) is saying, screening out all other stimuli.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[<a href="./images/116.png">116</a>]</span>
But why is this high order of concentration so easy under
hypnosis when Asians, notably the Chinese, have been trying
for centuries to concentrate on one subject for as long
as four or five seconds. We do not know the mechanics
of this metamorphosis of an ordinary brain into an organ
of concentrated power. According to Janet, this is accomplished
through the formation of a group of unconscious
memories and activities which takes over the usual stream-of-consciousness
type of thinking. It is implied that the
process may be atavistic.</p>

<p>One of the newer theories&mdash;one held by Dr. Lewis R.
Wolberg, a psychoanalyst&mdash;is that hypnosis is a psychosomatic
process in that it is both physiological and psychological
in character. Physiologically, Wolberg believes
that hypnosis represents an inhibition of the higher cortical
centers, and a limitation of sensory channels such as
takes place in sleep. He also believes that the psychological
process operates through transference. Others agree
that it is a transference process, but that it is more of an
extension of the subject's own psychic processes which is
enlarged to include the voice of the hypnotist or his own
thoughts or voice. Incidentally, an excellent book along
these theoretical lines is <i>Hypnotism&mdash;An Objective Study
in Suggestibility</i> by Andr&eacute; M. Weitzenhoffer, Ph.D.</p>

<p>The newest theory in the field is of particular interest
to those reading this book inasmuch as it postulates that
all hypnosis is self-hypnosis, that the patient always hypnotizes
himself and that it is a wise hypnotist who knows
who is hypnotizing whom. This is a logical conclusion and
it disperses any ideas that hypnotic patients become dependent
on their therapists. Actually, hypnotists today
always teach their subjects self-hypnosis so that any
chance of dependency is obviated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[<a href="./images/117.png">117</a>]</span></p>

<p>Milton V. Kline, professor of psychology at Long
Island University, postulates that hypnosis is primarily
retrogressive. He has written that the organism functions
differently on various levels of behavior (regression), and
that the behavior breaks down into component parts. The
theory that regression can spotlight personality disorders
found in more infantile states is also widely held. He also
is a proponent of the idea that hypnosis is an abnormal
manifestation of a normal process, an opinion he shares
with many.</p>

<p>Dr. Kline thinks that retrogression and regression alter
perceptions and feelings, and, in the case of the latter,
causes us to go backward in time to the point where re-education
may be employed. This is a legitimate use of
regression although it is not used so much these days to
uncover past traumatic incidents. Actually, regression, by
duplicating the exact earlier age, manner of speech and
thought, etc., makes us once more as little children, a condition
to be desired for certain forms of therapy.</p>

<p>An atavistic theory, held to some extent by Dr. Jerome
M. Schneck, clinical associate professor of psychiatry,
State University of New York College of Medicine, is
that hypnosis should be equated with states of immobilization
on the basis of his observation that some subjects
equate hypnosis with "death." He suggests this is comparable
to the "death-feint" of animals to avoid danger.
Others, primarily Europeans, have pointed out the analogy
between the hypnotic state of animals and man.</p>

<p>Another widely-held theory is that hypnosis is a state
of dissociation, meaning that it constitutes a group of unconscious
memories and activities which may be dredged
up to replace the stream of consciousness. Automaticism,
of course, is inherently part of this view, and is presumed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[<a href="./images/118.png">118</a>]</span>
to negate volition. Activity of the cerebrum, which controls
the conscious and voluntary system, is rendered non-operational.</p>

<p>My own thoughts on the matter are that hypnosis results
from, first of all, a good transference; secondly, from a
conditioned reflex; thirdly, from the person acting as a
hypnotized person (role playing), and, fourthly, from a
suspension of the critical faculties. Along the last-named
line, I believe that hypnotic suggestions have an autonomy
of their own which supersede all else in the hypnotic
situation. There are many more theories I believe are partially
correct, but the ones named will do for the purposes
of this volume. Incidentally, all the hypnosis theories presented
are equally applicable to self-hypnosis except where,
as in transference, it is obvious a therapist is needed.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the author would like to take issue with
those who believe that it is the monotonous intonations of
the therapist that cause the subject to lapse from the
deeply relaxed state into true sleep. I have observed many
times, by comparing verbalization with silence, that the
former gives the subject's mind a focal point of attention
which prevents him from entering a sleep state where hypnotherapy
is impossible. Like the man who cannot sleep
because of an active mind, sleep and myriad thoughts and
suggestions are incompatible, and I believe, once a hypnotic
state has been attained, that the subject is kept awake
(unless definite sleep suggestions are given) by the therapist's
series of suggestions. We have discussed the effect
of the experiential background at length, and surely nothing
connotates sleep more than closing one's eyes&mdash;test
No. 1. And so, in my view, you are doing two things when
you talk to the subject; you are giving him helpful suggestions,
but you are also keeping him awake and hyperacute
so that these suggestions will sink in.</p>

<h2><a name="chapter13" id="chapter13"></a><i>Chapter 13</i></h2>

<h3>Practical Applications of Self-Hypnosis</h3>


<p>With hypnosis on the march, there is practically no
limit to its uses in the field of medicine, and new applications
are being discovered every day. It should not be
necessary to add, however, that some of these uses should
remain as they are&mdash;in the hands of professionals with
years of experience in the area. One of the themes of this
book has been that laymen should use hypnosis discriminately
and intelligently. No responsible therapist would
ever recommend masking or removing a symptom which
was indicative of organic disease. For that reason, the
practical uses of self-hypnosis will be limited to measures
that can be taken safely by the layman. The only possible
exception to this will be instructions on how to curb obesity,
but even here it is suggested that a physician be consulted
before embarking on a weight-reducing program.</p>

<p>The foremost use of hypnosis has been for relaxation,
and it becomes more and more important as world tensions,
anxiety and strain increase daily and millions seek
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[<a href="./images/120.png">120</a>]</span>
vainly to "get away from it all." Inasmuch as all methods
of hypnosis discussed in this book utilized relaxation as
the first step, it should not be necessary to go over this
material. Simply review the many induction techniques.</p>

<p>Lung cancer has become a very real threat to many
people today, and the professional hypnotist is besieged
with men and women who wish to curtail or quit smoking.
This is easier said than done because smoking, although
there are no physical withdrawal symptoms when one
stops, is a strong, conditioned reflex and cannot (except
in rare instances) be accomplished by the will alone. The
best way to stop smoking is to make it an impossibility,
and that is exactly what you do when you follow the
method touched on in an earlier chapter.</p>

<p>All of us have tasted or smelled certain foods or medicines
that nauseate us. The subject who wishes to quit
smoking is asked to conjure up the vision and the actual
taste and smell of the substances which upset his stomach
and offend his nostrils, transferring its properties to cigarettes.
This, of course, must be done under hypnosis. The
subject then conditions himself in the following manner:
One ... This cigarette tastes and smells just like (mention
name of repugnant substance). Two ... It is the most vile
and repugnant taste I have ever encountered, and I shall
not be able to continue after the third puff. At the third
puff, I will develop a paroxysm of coughing. Three ... I
cannot smoke the cigarette any longer, and I will have to
put it out.</p>

<p>This sounds like a simple procedure, and yet it has
worked for thousands. Some switch to chewing gum or
candy, but the cure essentially lies in substituting one conditioned
reflex for another. This is comparatively easy
with hypnosis because, unlike narcotics, barbiturates or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[<a href="./images/121.png">121</a>]</span>
alcohol, smoking is purely a psychological addiction.
There is no need for tapering off.</p>

<p>Stopping drinking, unlike smoking, doesn't involve
merely the creation of a physical aversion to the drug.
The patient's entire personality should be changed and
more mature viewpoints substituted for the unrealistic
and infantile viewpoints which lead to the addiction in
the first place. The subject should give himself suggestions
that he will be able to "face up" to the problems of
every day life without recourse to the crutch of alcohol.
It is a well-known fact that nothing is as bad as we think
it is going to be once we confront it.</p>

<p>One of the strange aspects of drinking is that it is
actually a form of self-hypnosis, and the cure lies in substituting
a new viewpoint for the old. This fact can be
demonstrated by the fact that drinking is begun in the
first place so that the individual can be "one of the boys"
or because it is the thing to do. Those who do not drink,
at least as a social lubricant, according to this code, are
"squares." Because of this, self-hypnosis must be directed
toward reorienting one's sense of values. Sober reflection
should convince anyone that the truly intelligent person
does not drink to excess.</p>

<p>Nail biting is an unsightly habit, one that may even
hinder one's social acceptance. The help lies in a therapeutic
approach similar to that for cigarettes.</p>

<p>It is not hard to predict that many of those reading these
pages are suffering from overweight. With 30 million
Americans in this category, it has become one of the nation's
chief health problems, and it is the predisposing
factor in many other diseases such as heart trouble, diabetes,
hypertension and atherosclerosis. If you are overweight,
it is well to remember that (unless you are one in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>[<a href="./images/122.png">122</a>]</span>
a million) you cannot blame your glands. The plain truth
is that you eat too much.</p>

<p>We know today that overeating for some is an emotional
problem, stemming from feelings of rejection and
insecurity. Individuals who feel unloved, whether this is
truly the case or not, make up for this lack to themselves
by stuffing in large quantities of food. It would even
appear that these people are masochistic, making themselves
even more unloved by their gross gastronomical
habits. A big factor in overweight in women is "raiding
the refrigerator" while doing their housework. Most of
them do this so unconsciously that they swear they eat
less than most people.</p>

<p>There are a number of appetite-curbing drugs on the
market today, but they should not be necessary for anyone
who has acquired self-hypnosis. If you have learned to
visualize yourself (visual-imagery) in different situations,
you will have no trouble in picturing yourself having a
slim, attractive figure, exactly as you were when you felt
you looked your best. Keep this figure ever in mind and use
it along with conditioning yourself against certain fatty
and starchy foods. A trick used by some hypnotherapists
is to have the subject purchase a dress or suit several sizes
too small and then work toward being able to wear it.
This actually has worked in many cases because it adds
the element of competitiveness to the procedure.</p>

<p>Not all people overeat because of emotional problems.
Some come from families where "licking the platter
clean" was the rule because food was scarce. Others come
from rich families where overeating by the parents established
a habit pattern in the children. Certain races and
nationalities look on fat as a badge of wealth and prestige,
and children in such an environment are likely to be deliberately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>[<a href="./images/123.png">123</a>]</span>
overfed. Regardless of the reason for overweight,
however, the use of self-hypnosis is one of the
answers to the problem.</p>

<p>Simple headaches, arthritis, neuritis and other painful
symptoms yield readily to hypnotic suggestion. If physicians
have given up on the problem and placed a subject
on a maintenance drug dosage for pain, hypnosis can
potentiate the drugs or even obviate them.</p>

<p>Two of the major uses of hypnosis are in childbirth and
for intractable pain of cancer or some other incurable
diseases. Although patients usually start with hetero-hypnosis,
they are put on self-hypnosis as soon as possible,
and there are many cases of women waiting too long
and having their babies at home painlessly through self-hypnosis.
The father invariably is the only one excited
in such cases. The mother knows that she is an excellent
subject and has been instructed in prenatal classes about
every contingency that could arise. Inasmuch as stopping
the birth pangs is similar to stopping other pain, the
method should be learned so that it can be accomplished
in a minimum of time.</p>

<p>The best way to stop pain is to let your right arm
slowly rise while you are under hypnotic suggestion. Do not
help it. If the suggestions are strong enough, it will "float"
up. As soon as the arm is straight overhead, you should
give yourself the suggestion that it is as rigid and unbending
as a bar of steel. Following this, a suggestion is given
that the hand is beginning to tingle and become numb. As
soon as the numbness has spread through the entire hand,
it will be insensible to pain. The hand is then placed
against the part of the body where pain exists, and you
will feel the numbness flowing from the hand to the
affected area. This happens as a result of your suggestions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>[<a href="./images/124.png">124</a>]</span>
and is the method followed by most subjects. Only a deep
somnambulistic subject is able to remove pain by direct
suggestion to the painful part.</p>

<p>There are many people today using self-hypnosis in the
realm of sports, and an entire book has been written on
improving one's golf game with this method. It is called
<i>How You Can Play Better Golf Using Self-Hypnosis</i> by
Jack Heise (Wilshire Book Company&mdash;Publishers).</p>

<p>Dr. Huber Grimm, team physician of the Seattle University
basketball team, recently related the results when
Dave Mills, a six-foot five-inch junior forward, asked for
his help because he "froze" during competition. He had
been benched on the eve of the West Coast Athletic Conference
tournament in San Francisco. Spectators made
Mills so fearful that he was afraid he would make mistakes&mdash;and
in this frame of mind, of course, he did. Under
hypnosis, Dr. Grimm suggested to Dave that he would be
unaware of the spectators, be completely relaxed and
would play exceedingly well. Dr. Grimm asked coach
Vince Cazzeta to allow Dave to play and the result was
astounding. Mills scored 60 points and cleared 63 re-bounds,
and his brilliant play led to his selection on the
all-tournament team.</p>

<p>"All I did was free his spirit," Dr. Grimm reported.
"He was in need of confidence, and I gave it to him
through hypnosis." The Associated Press told the story as
follows: "Dave Mills, a vacuum cleaner off the back-boards,
led a fast-breaking Seattle University team to victory
last night. It was hard to recognize Mills as the same
player who has been with the Chieftains all year."</p>

<p>Dr. William S. Kroger, a pioneer in hypnosis, undertook
to improve the batting of a professional baseball
player with equally sensational results. The player had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[<a href="./images/125.png">125</a>]</span>
been "beaned," and his fear of a recurrence was so strong
that he became "plate shy." He had changed his batting
stance so that he always had "one foot in the bucket" so
that he could back away from the plate more quickly. He
was given a posthypnotic suggestion that such an event
happening again was exceedingly remote, and this was
amplified by suggestions of confidence that he would
immediately start slugging as well as ever. His batting
average soared immediately.</p>

<p>Dr. Michio Ikai, professor of physiology at Tokyo
University, and Dr. Arthur H. Steinhaus of the George
Williams Laboratory of Physiologic Research in Physical
Education, Chicago, have proved that track men can far
surpass their best previous times under hypnosis. Their
tests, incidentally, proved that there is no danger of an
athlete going beyond his physiologic limit while bettering
his former marks. They attribute the superior performances
to the removal of inhibitions, which psychologically
prevent an athlete from doing his best. This report was
made before the International Congress on Health and
Fitness in the Modern World held in Rome during the
last Olympic games.</p>

<p>All reports, as a matter of fact, show that athletic performances
are improved by psychological, not physical,
means, and that built-in automatic reflexes protect the
athlete against the danger of overexertion at all levels of
awareness&mdash;hypnotic or non-hypnotic.</p>

<p>Psychologists are using hypnosis more and more to
facilitate concentration and learning, and it is likely this
use of the ancient science will become even more popular
than its medical applications. The reason one learns so
quickly under hypnosis is because of time distortion which
allows you to obtain the equivalent of many hours of study
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>[<a href="./images/126.png">126</a>]</span>
in a relatively short length of time.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, you have had experience with time distortion
in your daily life. Remember how slowly time goes
when you are not interested in what you are doing and
how fast it speeds by when you are? And the drowning
man, who sees his whole life go by, is an excellent example
of this. Enough people have been saved to know
that this actually happens. The point is that the subconscious
mind does not record the passage of time the same
way as the conscious mind.</p>

<p>The conscious mind records time physically, by means
of a clock. It is objective and tells you that a thought or
movement requires a certain number of seconds, minutes,
hours or days.</p>

<p>Your subconscious mind has an entirely different concept
of time that has nothing to do with the physical
world. It is called subjective because your own sense of
the passage of time is used.</p>

<p>Personal time varies according to the circumstances in
which you find yourself. Haven't you noticed that when
you are happy or extremely interested in something, time
passes quickly? On the other hand, if you are sad or anxious,
time seems to drag.</p>

<p>This is called time distortion. When you continue in a
happy state, time is automatically shortened. When you
are in a state of unhappiness, pain or anxiety, time automatically
lengthens. This explains why the drowning man
can review his entire life within seconds. Psychologists
know this is possible, because your subconscious mind
contains a complete record of everything that has happened
to you since birth. Therefore, in moments of extreme
distress your subconscious has the ability to distort
and manipulate time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[<a href="./images/127.png">127</a>]</span></p>

<p>If you have ever encountered danger or had a narrow
escape, you probably experienced time distortion. Everything
about you went into slow motion, and time seemed
to stand still until the action was over. At that point,
objective time started up again and everything returned
to normal.</p>

<p>Many of you no doubt read an Associated Press report
from Chicago on February 11, 1958, which reported how
movie actress Linda Darnell had used hypnosis to help
her with her first stage role. She had been asked to do the
part on short notice and had no time for preparation. Miss
Darnell telephoned her California physician for aid. He
flew to Chicago.</p>

<p>Overnight, through hypnosis, Miss Darnell learned her
part and astounded the cast by knowing everyone's lines.
Not only did she learn the part, but she was coached in
the character of the artist she was portraying. As a result,
"Late Love" was a hit play. Miss Darnell was under the
impression she had been learning the part for a week
although only about 48 hours were involved and these
hours were not continuous. After her first performance,
she said: "I never felt so secure about playing a role in my
life. Hypnosis helped me feel the part completely."</p>

<p>Imagine how much more we are going to be able to
learn when study under hypnosis becomes widespread.
And the best part of it is that the learning is in your
mind for a long time. Forgetting or mental blocks that
interfere with your recall of the information at any time,
are reduced to a minimum.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I should like to recommend the entire
field of self-hypnosis to everyone. It is a therapy which is
positive, dynamic and constructive. An excellent example
of this is contained in the autobiography, <i>Rachmaninoff's</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[<a href="./images/128.png">128</a>]</span>
<i>Recollections</i>. In this book, immortal Rachmaninoff describes
in detail his success in overcoming a severe case of
mental depression. He had stopped composing and kept to
himself, seldom leaving his room. After meeting with failure,
using the available therapeutic remedies available at
that time, he was persuaded by his relatives, the Satins,
to seek the help of a hypnotist called Dr. Dahl. With
much reluctance, he agreed to see Dr. Dahl and be
treated specifically with hypnosis. Rachmaninoff's own
words read as follows: "Although it may sound incredible,
hypnosis really helped me. Already at the beginning
of the summer I began again to compose. The material
grew in bulk, and new musical ideas began to stir within
me&mdash;far more than I needed for my concerto. I felt that
Dr. Dahl's treatment had strengthened my nervous system
to a miraculous degree. Out of gratitude, I dedicated my
second concerto to him. As the piece had a great success
in Moscow, everyone began to wonder what possible connection
it could have with Dr. Dahl. The truth, however,
was known to Dr. Dahl, the Satins, and myself."</p>

<p>Does this story sound incredible? You have the word
of one of the world's greatest musical composers that
hypnosis alleviated his severe despondency. This is proof
that the emotions of the individual can be changed by the
ideas he builds up about himself.</p>

<p>Dr. Leland E. Hinsie, professor of psychiatry, Columbia
University, writing in his book, <i>The Person in the Body</i>,
(W. W. Norton &amp; Co.) states, "In some persons the fear
of disease is often the only damaging evidence of disease,
yet it can be so strong as to disable the person in all his
daily activities." The entire field of psychosomatic medicine,
which deals with the interrelationship between body
and mind, has as one of its basic tenets that suggestion not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[<a href="./images/129.png">129</a>]</span>
only can cause psychological personality disorders, but
many physical disorders as well.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, logical to conclude that the systematic
use of positive mental attitudes in an organized, progressive,
self-improvement program can be a vital influence in
helping you lead a healthier life, both emotionally and
physically.</p>

<p>Many people in need of help are at a loss as to where
they can locate reputable hypnotherapists in their area.
You may consult your family physician, county medical
society or mental hygiene society. The chairman of the
psychology department at your nearest college or university
would usually have this information. I maintain a file
of over 4,000 doctors located all over the world who practice
hypnosis and would be pleased to refer you to doctors
located in your locality.</p>

<h2>THE POWERS HYPNOTIC EYES</h2>

<p>Here is an original technique that can be used very successfully in
inducing hypnosis. The technique consists of using two glass eyes
with eyelashes that close as you rotate the mechanism that holds
the eyes in place. This action is similar to closing your eyes when
falling asleep. You suggest to the subject as you hold these two
eyes between your thumb and first finger that his eyes will become
extremely heavy and tired as the eyes that you are holding begin to
close. You then gradually begin to rotate your hand which causes
the eyes to partially close. The subject, finding it extremely difficult
to look at the eyes, begins to close his own eyes in unison with
those that you are holding. You continue giving suggestions of
hypnosis and before you know it the subject is under hypnosis.
The eyes are the size of human eyes and are colored blue with
brown eyelashes in order to give the exact effect of looking into
real eyes.</p>

<p>The advantage comes in the fact that the subject begins to blink
his eyes immediately and you suggest to him that this is the beginning
of the hypnosis. It is just about impossible to look into anyone's
eyes without blinking and this technique accomplishes this purpose.
Using this knowledge, you incorporate it into your technique
and induce the deep hypnosis accordingly. You can, of
course, use this technique for self-hypnosis as well.</p>

<p>I have had many requests for a hypnotic crystal
ball and chain. I finally have been able to secure
these and am offering them now for the
first time. The crystal ball measures one inch in
diameter and is actually made of genuine methacrylate
which is crystal clear. A ten inch chain is
secured to the crystal ball. You use this device
the same as the regular crystal ball but this time
you incorporate the pendulum effect which naturally
causes the quick tiring of the eyes.</p></div>

<h2>THE HAND HYPNODISC</h2>

<div class="clearfix"><div class="figleft">

</div>

<p>The hand hypnodisc is the size of the hypnodisc
illustrated in this circular. It is rigid with
a special lens-like plastic surface. The miniature
hypnodisc is held between the first finger
and thumb like the crystal ball and is used incorporating
the techniques of the large hypnodisc
as well as the crystal ball.</p>

<p>As you slowly revolve this hypnodisc, the
lens-like surface causes a series of optical illusions
to appear before the eyes of the subject.
These moving illusions are ever present as you
change the slightest distance of the hypnodisc
from the subject.</p>

<p>This remarkable effect is achieved by the use
of countless plastic linear lenses which separate
the multiple images laminated behind
them, permitting a different picture to change
continuously as you change the angle of view
or distance. Naturally this device is extremely
helpful in capturing the full attention of the
conscious mind of the subject and helps you to
achieve the hypnotic state in the shortest possible
time.</p></div>

<p>The Powers hypnotic crystal ball is extremely
useful as an aid in inducing the hypnotic state.
It is desirable to use it as an object of concentration
for your subject while he is being
hypnotized.</p>

<p>The crystal ball lends an air of "mysticism"
to the attainment of the hypnotic sleep and for
some of your subjects this is the best approach
in obtaining hypnotic control. There are individuals
who will not react to a strict scientific
approach to hypnosis and it is with these subjects
that the use of such a device as the crystal
ball is of inestimable value.</p>

<p>The crystal ball is held between your thumb
and first finger, about twelve inches from the
subject's eyes and slightly above eye level. The
hypnotic crystal ball can easily be carried with
you at all times.</p>

<p>As you know, the employment of a crystal to
induce the hypnotic sleep is one of the oldest
methods used in hypnosis. I personally favor
this device and my students as well as myself
have always had excellent results using this
technique.</p>

<p><b>Copyright 1951 by Melvin Powers</b></p>

<p>An effective yet inexpensive method
of inducing hypnosis is with the aid
of the hypnodisc spiral. In my book,
"Hypnotism Revealed," a picture of
the hypnodisc unit with the hypnodisc
spiral attached is shown. Above
is a picture of my latest hypnodisc
spiral. I am now offering the hypnodisc
spiral as a separate unit which
can be used with your phonograph
turntable.</p>

<p>The spinning spiral will cause a
series of optical illusions, causing immediate
eye strain and fatigue. The
subject feels that he is being drawn into a deep, dark revolving cone. By your
suggestions of hypnotic sleep, you can place your subject in the somnambulistic
state very easily. With some subjects, hypnosis will take place almost
instantaneously. This technique is often employed in stage hypnotism.</p>

<p>The use of the hypnodisc spiral is also an excellent method of achieving
self-hypnosis. As you concentrate on the revolving hypnodisc spiral, you give
yourself suggestions of hypnotic sleep. You will note the optical illusions as
they occur and the pleasant, relaxing feeling that accompanies these illusions.
Giving yourself further suggestions of hypnotic sleep, you find that you are
easily able to attain the desired state of self-hypnosis. This method is one of
the most successful and popular techniques yet known for achieving hetero-hypnosis
and self-hypnosis. At the Wilshire School of Hypnotism, all students
in the self-hypnosis class are conditioned with the aid of the hypnodisc spiral.</p>

<p>During my lectures, I place the entire hypnodisc unit on the platform without
having the spiral revolve. Continuing with the lecture, I note individuals
in the audience gazing intently at the hypnodisc spiral. Invariably before the
end of the lecture, many will have put themselves into a deep hypnotic state.
This group self-hypnosis was achieved without my mentioning anything about
the hypnodisc. These individuals assumed that the unit is used to induce
hypnosis and their looking at it with that thought in mind produced the hypnotic
state.</p>

<p>The hypnodisc spiral is printed on firm cardboard, measures twelve inches
in diameter, and has a hole in the center so you can place it on your own
phonograph turntable. It has the general appearance of a twelve-inch phonograph
record. I am sure that you will be pleased with your purchase of the
hypnodisc.</p>

<p>The hypnodisc is also available with four of the white spiraling areas colored
in four different shades. The coloring is extremely interesting, fascinating,
and very effective in inducing hypnosis as the hypnodisc revolves. The
COLORED HYPNODISC sells for $3.00.</p>

<h2>ONE HOUR HYPNOTIC RAIN TAPE (3-3/4 IPS)</h2>

<p>One of the chief assets of a good hypnotist is to be flexible in his approach in
hypnotizing his subjects. As you know, it is necessary many times to adapt a technique
that is suitable to the subject, and not to make the subject adapt himself to the
method of induction.</p>

<p>We know that with somnambulistic subjects any procedure will put the subject
under hypnosis immediately. The hypnotist gains complete control of his subject
just as fast as he wants. Unfortunately, most subjects do not respond at the first
session because of conscious or subconscious fears that must be gradually eliminated.
Once you get the subject to relax, or "let go," he will naturally succumb to hypnosis.
This is the problem that confronts all hypnotists.</p>

<p>Merely suggesting to the subject to relax or to "let go" is not sufficient, as
a rule, to bring about this desired state. The subject, at this point, cannot turn
on or off his mental and physical state of being this easily. Even if we have the
subject lie down, this does not assure the hypnotic state, as the subject can still
be tense. Our problem is how to get the subject to relax. Our situation is similar
to the physician telling his patient to go home and forget about a certain
problem. I'm sure that you'll agree that the advice is virtually impossible to follow.</p>

<p>One of the major stumbling blocks in hypnotizing a subject, or in self-hypnosis,
lies in the fact that although we use words such as: "relax," "let yourself go," and
other similar terminology, the subject cannot readily put the meaning of these
words into effect. It is difficult for most people to "let go" when we live in a society
that beckons us to "look sharp," "be sharp," "be alert," "be on the ball" and "make
every minute count." Emphasis on productivity does not lend to a society of relaxed
individuals.</p>

<p>In my long experience as a professional hypnotist, I have tried many novel
innovations for inducing hypnosis. Some have met with a great deal of success
and others have failed. It is difficult to determine the causative factors for success
or failure. We can only theorize.</p>

<p>I have used, over the last ten years, a technique that I shall describe now. Exceptionally
good results have been attained with it; however, it is not infallible. It is
suggested to you as another good technique. In order to help the subject relax, I
have been using a one hour tape recorder recording containing the continuous sound
of various degrees of rain. One half hour has a rain effect of very soft, light rainfall,
as on grass, canvas or tent top. The other side contains a half hour of a rain effect such
as one would hear in a heavy downfall with prominent patter of water on pavement.</p>

<p>The subject is instructed to close his eyes and listen to the sound of the rain while
picturing himself relaxing near a warm, glowing fireplace. The relaxing effect thus
produced enhances our chances for success in attaining a deep, hypnotic state.</p>

<p>The tape will play on all standard recorders and comes recorded at a speed of
3-3/4 IPS. The tape alone is worth $2.50. You therefore only pay $2.50 for the actual
recording.</p>
